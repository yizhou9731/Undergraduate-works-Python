The palate sizzles with saltiness and a lemony acidity that cuts through its brown butter richness with finesse. The finish is luxurious and long."
US,95,45.0,Pinot Noir,Comartin,"San Jose-based producer Adam Comartin heads 1,100 feet up into the mountains to source fruit for this tremendous wine, which offers wild cherry, sage, and eucalyptus scents on the nose.

France,91,45.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Chenevières,"L'Homme Mort is a northern extension of the Fourchaume Premier Cru vineyard, so called because this was where a local lord dispensed justice by death.

Italy,86,45.0,Sangiovese,Il Grappolo,"The nose is a bit shy but eventually reveals underbrush, red berry and a toasted note. The straightforward palate is quite lean, offering raw sour cherry, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of ground pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,86,48.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Ehret,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend boasts leather, tobacco leaf and black pepper flavors, giving it muscle and a rustic edge, the tannins and fruit mellowed with age."
US,86,20.0,Moscato,EOS,"Fans of stickies may find pleasure in this bottling, but it is tremendously sweet and oily. Candied honeydew and kiwi scents meet with sweet juniper and pine on the nose. On the palate, it tastes squarely of golden honey. It's soft, unctuous and thick in consistency."
US,86,17.0,Pinot Grigio,Martinez & Martinez,"Aromas of ripe (leaning almost overripe) apple, melon and orange peel are followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors. It needs more acid to stand it up."
US,86,12.0,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone,"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance."
US,86,10.0,Chardonnay,Leaping Horse,"This medium-bodied wine has more earthy and floral flavors than straightforward fruit, so it's something a bit different. Well-priced and easy to drink, it can please a crowd."
US,86,13.0,White Blend,Kitchen Sink,"This wine is dry and substantial, emphasizing earthy, savory flavors over fruity ones. An attractive walnut and almond element carries through from the aroma to the flavors."
US,86,45.0,Chardonnay,Kuleto Estate,"This is from a hillside estate vineyard and is entirely barrel fermented, its oak subtle and supportive. Medium bodied and not overripe, it offers honeysuckle aromas and lime and lemon rind flavors."
Portugal,86,12.0,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"This state-owned estate of forests and vineyards grows organic grapes. This wine, softly structured and ripe has light black fruits and plenty of acidity. An undercurrent of tannin keeps the wine in order and will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
Argentina,86,12.0,Rosé,Zorzal,"This copper-tinted rosé of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish."
US,86,125.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug,"This mountain-grown wine is hugely tannic and oaky, hard to penetrate in its full-bodied ripeness. Smoky oak and currant flavors vie for attention against a backdrop of concentration and power."
US,86,25.0,Riesling,Millbrook,"Savory apples and pears mingle into lemon and bramble in this slightly earthy off-dry Riesling. Sunny tangerine acidity is easy but bright, leading a delicately sweet finish."
South Africa,86,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Waterkloof,"Muted aromas of tart gooseberry and lime peel dance in the bouquet, while pithy flavors of plum skin, currant and citrus rind unfold on the lightweight, slightly astringent palate. Pleasant hints of fresh herbs and saline make a fleeting impression on the close."
Argentina,86,15.0,Malbec,Viñalba,"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show."
Spain,86,,Monastrell,Casa de la Ermita,"Aromas of brandied cherry and crème de cassis include a horsey sidenote and some heat. This sweet Monastrell smacks the palate with hard tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and baked plum finish blocky."
France,86,20.0,Rosé,Château Clément Termes,"This pale pink-grey colored wine is a blend of Duras and Merlot. It is lively and fruity, with a red-currant flavor, delicious crisp acidity and a soft, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
France,86,15.0,Gamay,Château Coutinel,This softly fruity wine has the lightest of tannins and plenty of simple red-berry fruits. There is an earthy edge to the young wine as well as plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.
Portugal,86,7.0,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,"This broad, fruity wine brings out ripe berry flavors in spades. It has generous fruit, soft tannins and a smooth, open texture. Drink now."
US,91,59.0,Pinot Noir,MacPhail,"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness."
US,91,49.0,Pinot Noir,Foursight,"This small-quantity selection from within the Charles Vineyard was fermented by native yeast, and neither fined nor filtered. It is quite aromatic, full bodied and moderately fruity, and has a nice rounded mouthfeel, generous red-cherry and spice flavors and good structure from acidity and mild tannins. Tart cherry lingers on the finish."
US,91,42.0,Sparkling Blend,Goat Bubbles,"A deeper salmon color with elegantly lacy bubbles and a slight cloudy appearance, this sparkler by Norm Yost offers dessicated watermelon, dried orange blossoms, yeast, citrus rinds and fresher strawberry notes on the nose. Tart raspberry and yeasty melon show on the palate, which offers a salty component as well as a surprising but nice amount of grip."
US,91,93.0,Chardonnay,Grgich Hills,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
US,91,32.0,Pinot Noir,Navarro,"This wine is tasty, tangy and nervy, bringing a very refreshing and appetizing mouthfeel, and wonderful fresh acidity. All of that tang shows good fruitiness too, as the red-cherry and cranberry flavors are vivid and concentrated. It's a versatile wine to drink now or buy by the case to save some bottles for more aging."
US,91,20.0,Pinot Noir,Navarro,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication."
US,90,100.0,Zinfandel,Renwood,"Renwood's tiny two-barrel production of its most expensive Zinfandel has aromas like vanilla and coconut and flavors as rich as milk chocolate and strawberry jam. This full-bodied wine is practically a liquid dessert, though it's not overly sweet. It's full-bodied, smooth and broad in texture."
US,90,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero,"This is a thick, chocolatey wine with a side of leather and black pepper that appeals on multiple levels. Full-bodied concentration gives way to a smooth, rounded palate robust in blackberry and vanilla."
Spain,90,22.0,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey,"Aromas of strawberry, currant and spice are good in a subtle, non-pushy way. Fresh and grabby on the palate, this tastes of red fruits, baking spices and cocoa. Drying tannins along with cassis and chocolate flavors push a healthy finish. Drink through 2020."
Italy,90,45.0,White Blend,Biondi,"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity."
Italy,90,18.0,Greco,Cantine di Marzo,"Juicy and delicious, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit and fragrant Spanish broom. The succulent palate doles out crisp Granny Smith apple, Anjou pear, nectarine and mineral alongside bright acidity."
US,90,45.0,Chardonnay,Alexander-Smith,"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet-sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes. The texture is quite pithy once sipped, showing grapefruit and apple skins, and then it warms toward yellow pears and a sea salt warmth."
US,90,26.0,Barbera,Andis,"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat."
US,90,16.0,Chardonnay,Benziger,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal."
US,90,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaucanon,"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020."
US,90,42.0,Grenache,Brecon Estate,"Quite dark in color, brooding aromas of olallieberry, blackberry, grape soda, plums and concentrated purple flowers appease the nose on this bottling from one of Paso's newly designated appellations. The palate blends licorice, turned earth and eucalyptus with a fresh pomegranate juice flavor."
US,90,38.0,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon,"A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame."
US,90,48.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Three,"Heavy fruit concentration meets thick, velvety tannins in this full-bodied, deeply colored and extremely flavorful wine. It's big enough to pair with big proteins, and concentrated enough to keep improving in the cellar. Best after 2019."
Spain,90,17.0,Tempranillo,Valdelacierva,"Cherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla. Notes of café mocha and toast grace a crisp finish that isn't trying too hard."
France,90,18.0,Rosé,Château de Lancyre,"Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close."
France,90,15.0,Rosé,Château Suau,"Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now."
US,90,28.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Clif Family,"A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair."
US,90,25.0,Grenache,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors."
US,90,26.0,Chardonnay,Schmidt,"Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power."
US,90,24.0,Albariño,Stephen Ross,"Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albariño has much promise in the state."
US,90,55.0,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye,"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture."
US,90,36.0,Zinfandel,Grgich Hills,"This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power."
Spain,90,17.0,Albariño,Mar de Viñas,"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albariño. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish."
US,90,40.0,Syrah,Kessler-Haak,"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice."
US,90,28.0,Malvasia Bianca,Larner,"This most intriguing white grape, which the Larners grow as an ode to their Italian past, shows a sweet nose with a bone dry palate. Sugary citrus scents of orange blossoms and peach syrup give way to a brisk palate full of honeysuckle, night jasmine and a nearly pine needle bitterness that cuts dynamically through it all."
US,89,50.0,Pinot Noir,Bomb,"Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish."
Greece,89,24.0,White Blend,Hatzimichalis,"This wine is a conversation starter, with its nose of mandarin orange, lemon peel and vanilla. On the palate, white flowers, citrus and lush tropical fruits mingle well. Pair with salmon and poultry."
Spain,89,17.0,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas,"Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease."
Greece,89,21.0,Assyrtiko,Boutari,"Bright aromas of citrus and tropical fruit give this easygoing white an easy appeal. Balanced and fresh, it's an elegant wine that will pair well with grilled fish and salads."
Greece,89,18.0,Malagouzia,Alpha Estate,"Peach, pear and lemon on the nose start this cheerful white from Alpha Estate. On the palate, it offers some complexity of exotic fruit and with a vein of acidity. Soft overall in profile, this wine is easygoing and enjoyable."
Chile,89,20.0,Carmenère,Viña Bisquertt,"Lightly herbal, horsey aromas of blueberry, black plum and cardamom are ripe by Carmenère standards. Hailing from a hot vintage, this is a bit flabby in feel, with soft tannins. Chunky plum and blackberry flavors finish with notes of licorice and mint along with a chewy, syrupy feel."
France,89,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chateau Quattre,"This well-balanced, fruity wine allows space for some solid dry tannins that also show wood aging. Berry fruits shine through the structure to give a juicy character that is underlined by the fresh acidity at the end."
US,89,24.0,Sangiovese,Ledger David,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip."
Spain,89,44.0,Tempranillo,CVNE,"Aromas of leather, roast plum and compost are challenging and not immediately inviting. In the mouth, this shows rubbery tannins and juicy acidity. Saucy, herbal plum and currant flavors ride on a beam of acidity toward an earthy, tomatoey finish with a lightly leafy aftertaste."
Chile,89,19.0,Red Blend,Estampa,"Staunch berry, cassis and spice aromas are friendly and congruent. This Malbec-led blend is jammy in feel, a bit hollow in the middle, and easy to like as a whole. Blackberry and blueberry flavors finish fleshy, with soft tannins."
US,89,42.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Foxen 7200,"Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf."
US,89,35.0,Pinot Noir,Irvine Family Vineyards,"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability."
Spain,89,44.0,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres,"Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors. Toast, bitter chocolate and full-bodied weight push the finish on this oaky, ripe Rioja. Drink through 2020."
US,89,16.0,Syrah,Matchbook,"This medium-bodied wine shows an array of smoky, meaty aromas, along with ripe plum and tart blackberry flavors. Not at all overripe, but made with some restraint, it allows savory flavors like tarragon and anise to peek through. The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,89,23.0,Viognier,Eberle,"The grape's usual peachy aromas show on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle, along with lemon juice, honey and a touch of minerality. There is a nice mineral-driven tension on the palate, with flavors of apple and pear cider. It's a solid, down-the-middle take on the grape—not too ripe, not too thin."
US,89,36.0,Pinot Noir,Silvan Ridge,"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short."
Italy,89,25.0,Red Blend,Tenuta degli Dei,"Crushed plum, espresso, tobacco and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, the straightforward palate offers blackberries, red currants, clove and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89,22.0,Red Blend,Poggio Mandorlo,"Aromas of wild berries, violets and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The savory, easygoing palate offers mature black cherry, clove and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Drink through 2016."
Portugal,89,20.0,Touriga Nacional,Quinta das Carvalhas,"Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016."
US,89,25.0,Chardonnay,Occasio,"This has a light yellow color with a touch of green and a subtle smell of crisp green apples. Flavors that are richer than expected, like poached pears, butter and fig. The texture is rich, the body full and the ripe flavors linger on the finish."
US,89,42.0,Pinot Noir,Sanford,"Rhubarb, cola and pencil shavings emerge from the glass on this appellation blend from the longtime Santa Rosa Road winery, today owned by the Terlato family. Deeply earthy aromas of beet juice, root beer and dried berries arise on the palate, showing the region's typical blend of soil minerality and dark fruit."
Chile,89,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Santa Alba,"Dark, charred, lemony aromas of graphite, licorice and blackberry are horsey and baked. This blend of 85% Cab Sauv and 15% Cab Franc has an intense, blocky, pinching palate and heavy flavors of black fruits, resiny oak, spice and salt. A woody, tannic, raw feel to the finish creates a bumpy landing. Drink through 2021."
Greece,89,17.0,Agiorgitiko,Boutari,"Aromas of leather, cherry and plum lead this balanced red from Boutari. Ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon flavors carry the palate, with soft tannins giving a sultry feel."
US,89,49.0,Pinot Noir,Foursight,"Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins."
France,89,16.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Ogier,"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017."
Spain,89,30.0,Tinta de Toro,Pagos del Rey,"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018."
Italy,89,40.0,Sangiovese,Altesino,"Here's a sleek Sangiovese that opens with scents of toasted oak, vanilla, blue flowers and mature plum. The round palate is already accessible, serving up sweet black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and mint framed in assertive but fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89,57.0,Red Blend,Cabreo,"A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close."
US,89,29.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes,"Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out."
Chile,89,61.0,Red Blend,Casa Donoso,"Aromas of latex, tire rubber, spice, cured meat and berry fruits are rugged and require patience to sift through. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is big and grabby, but not precise, with loud, herbal, muscular flavors of stewed plum, licorice and peppercorn."
US,88,25.0,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong,"Focused streaks of high-acidity lemon and a low oak profile combine for a refreshing take on Chardonnay, the other components coming together in swathes of fennel and brine. The wine finishes with a hit of power."
US,88,25.0,Syrah,San Simeon,"Oak aromas takes center stage with this wine by the Riboli family, with black cherry extract and a nearly Bourbon-barrel character on the nose. The rich, deep red fruit carries to the palate, which gains complexity from licorice and a tiny bit of tar."
US,88,49.0,Pinot Noir,Siduri,"Super earthy, in the classic damp forest-floor way, this also offers hints of menthol, eucalyptus and tomato leaf. The wine begins light bodied, but builds up power and weight as it goes. Layered with black cherry and plum, it's dark and savory."
US,88,20.0,Picpoul,Syncline,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, this 100% varietal wine suggests kumquat, talc and wet stone. The flavor concentration is light with taut acidity the focus. It needs food; pair it with shellfish to see it shine."
Argentina,88,26.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Piattelli,"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend."
US,88,34.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pondera,"Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins."
US,88,38.0,Zinfandel,Tobin James,"This is a lush and powerful wine from a vineyard in the recently designated Paso Highlands district. Aromas suggest gingerbread topped with kirsch-soaked, chocolate-covered cherries. The palate is thick and heavy, with mocha, stewed plums, mashed cherries and black earth, which gain complexity from tannins and pencil lead."
US,88,38.0,Zinfandel,Tobin James,"Hailing from the recently designated Paso Highlands subappellation, this hearty wine shows earthy aromas of nutmeg, iron, hot rocks, loam and cherry extract. It's lush and ripe with cassis and black cherry fruit, yet shows a more elegant chalkiness on the palate as well, rounded out by cocoa powder."
Spain,88,25.0,Godello,Valdesil,"Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts—briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel."
Spain,87,22.0,Red Blend,Jaspi,"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time."
Argentina,87,15.0,Malbec,Tupun,"Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Beauregard Lagupeau,Bright fruit is allied to a more mineral structure to give a wine that shows the freshness of the vintage plus a more long-term view. It is cool with red fruits and some firm tannins that act as a background. Drink from 2017.
France,87,25.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château du Taillan,"Owned by the Cruse family, one of the Bordeaux wine aristocracy, this rich wine is dominated by Merlot, giving it ample weight. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the smoky edge to the wine, although this will soften. Drink from 2017."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Haye,"The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lalande Mausse,"Intensely tannic, this structured wine has layers of wood aging, along with juicy fruits and bright acidity. There's a strongly smoky element, the wine's fruitiness balanced by a dark, toasty aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,87,25.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Magnol,"This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The burnt toast character is still dominant, waiting for the attractive black currant fruits to catch up. It will develop into a bright, fruity wine, so wait until 2017."
US,87,10.0,Chardonnay,Grand Pacific,"A creamy, buttery texture wraps around a core of bright lemon and apple flavors. This is balanced slightly toward sweetness as the luxurious viscosity carries the vivid flavors into the finish."
US,87,18.0,Malbec,Hamilton,"This saignée-style wine is pale salmon in color, showing some bricking. It drinks dry with rounded suggestions of cherry and watermelon providing easy-drinking enjoyment."
US,87,18.0,Chardonnay,Heron Hill,"Zesty and mineral, this unoaked, citrusy Chardonnay would make a particularly refreshing apéritif. Flavors of Asian pear and quince are crisp and cutting on the palate. Enjoy now for it's vivacious style."
US,87,14.0,Riesling,Heron Hill,"Smoke and violet perfume are seductive on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Fresh green apple and pear flavors are tart but concentrated, wrapping up tightly with a squeaky-clean, lemon-lime finish."
US,87,14.0,Riesling,Fox Run,"Intense notes of crushed stone and slate permeate this stately off-dry Riesling. Pert lemon and tangerine flavors are zippy and fresh, but the wine is more a showcase for its brisk, stony style."
US,87,40.0,Cabernet Franc,Glenora,"Figs and spice perfume this tawny Cabernet Franc ice wine. It's a bit rustic in style, evoking layers of fallen leaves and potpourri melding with dusty raisins and figs. But it's elegantly crisp and the exotic, uniquely spicy character is seductive."
France,87,18.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Roc Taillade,"This ripe, now soft wine has gentle red fruits and soft acidity. It's ready to drink with its rich texture and smooth structure. The end is rounded, only just hinting at tannins."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Sénéjac,"Owned by the same family as Château Talbot in Saint-Julien, this vintage of Sénéjac is now mature, showing signs of leather and a firm structure rather than fruit. It's unlikely to develop further, so drink now."
US,87,10.0,Gewürztraminer,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is an aromatic wine with notes of rose water, pear and white flowers. It drinks medium sweet with abundant spice flavors throughout. Pair with spicy Thai dishes."
US,87,11.0,Merlot,Castle Rock,"The aromas of this wine suggest plum, herb and pencil eraser. It's full flavored with dark blue fruit and chalky, dry tannins. An affordable and approachable wine best enjoyed now."
US,87,36.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dussek Family Cellars,"Though just four years old, this wine seems advanced with notes of dried cherry, vanilla, dried tobacco and blackberry. The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins."
US,87,20.0,Cabernet Franc,Serenity,"Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms."
US,87,32.0,Grenache,Sol Stone,"The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins."
Spain,87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca,"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor."
Portugal,93,55.0,Portuguese Red,Poças,"A big, ripe and spicy wine, this is packed with woody notes as well as powerful fruit. It has solid tannins and dark flavors of bitter chocolate and black cherries. It's rich and concentrated, with good aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Italy,93,49.0,Nebbiolo,Rizzi,"Blue flower, ripe berry, baking spice and mint aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied, elegant wine. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mineral alongside firm, ripe tannins. It's young but already displays a great combination of structure and finesse."
US,93,50.0,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"There is earthy darkness and a hint of the forest in this Zin, grown at high elevation in the rocky soils of the Rockpile appellation, these vines planted in 2001. The wine is magnificently structured with complex, ripe blackberry and cherry compote coming to the fore slowly and seductively."
Italy,93,58.0,Nebbiolo,Sottimano,"Crushed raspberry, blue flower, tilled soil and graphite aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. It's still very young and needs to open up fully, but the palate already displays breeding and class. It offers ripe black cherry, ground black pepper, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound but fine tannins. Drink 2018–2026."
France,93,39.0,Riesling,Domaine Jean-Luc Mader,"The chalk soil of the Rosacker vineyard has produced a rich, intensely fruity wine that is shot through with steely minerality and a wonderful perfumed character. It's so crisp and fresh while also being densely textured and complex. The wine has a long future, drink from 2017."
France,93,65.0,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Morocco,93,35.0,Syrah-Grenache,Bernard Magrez,"Tones of black cherry, toffee, tobacco, tar and violet show boldly on the nose and palate of this Moroccan red. Powerful tannins provide a suitable backdrop for fruit and spice flavors alongside an ever-present sense of brightness that lasts into the finish."
Italy,93,80.0,Nebbiolo,Borgogno,"Intense aromas of dried rose, leather, truffle and crushed berry lead the nose. The ripe, forward palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry, cinnamon white pepper and sage alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2015–2022."
France,93,42.0,Riesling,Domaine François Schmitt,"Paradis is a parcel within the Pfingstberg Grand Cru, giving particularly fine and rich Riesling. This ripe and full-bodied wine manages to preserve all the elegance and style of the grape while having full tropical fruits, juicy acidity and a warm, rounded aftertaste. It will certainly age, so drink from 2017."
France,93,61.0,Riesling,Gustave Lorentz,"This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years."
US,93,58.0,G-S-M,Force Majeure,"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020."
US,93,38.0,Mourvèdre,Anglim,"More people would crave Mourvèdre if it were done in this style, with light rather than heavy leather scents alongside purple fruits. Once sipped, it hits the tastebuds with blueberry soda, tobacco, licorice, black pepper and wild game, all restrained and juicy rather than brooding and thick."
France,93,48.0,Riesling,Domaine Ostertag,"Rounded, rich and full in the mouth, this offers swathes of flowery, aromatic fruit that is still young, still in its primary stage. With just a hint of steely texture, the wine does have structure and aging potential. For now, it is generous and delicious."
US,93,50.0,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age."
Italy,93,58.0,Nebbiolo,Sottimano,"Ripe and delicious, this starts off with aromas of fresh violet, rose, perfumed berry, exotic spice and tilled earth. It's still young but the palate already delivers a great depth of flavors including juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2016 to 2021."
France,93,120.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Raymond-Lafon,"From one of the many recent exceptional years in Sauternes, this ripe, unctuous wine has balanced the rich honeyed fruit and the drier edge of botrytis. It's full in the mouth, with Seville orange and a light touch of ginger. Drink from 2019."
US,93,50.0,Syrah,Red Car,"A case study in cool-climate, estate-grown Syrah, the white pepper on the nose and palate is playful and exuberant, the acidity buoyant and lingering. The fruit takes on hushed tones of wild berry and bramble, with a soft texture inviting one in for more."
US,93,80.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Force Majeure,"Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the high alcohol and the use of 100% new French oak, most of the old vine nuances are still there—a wild mix of heather and herb with berry and grain scents that weave together in the mouth. Brambly and tart, with strawberry and cherry fruit, it's a compelling wine that keeps you on your toes."
US,93,40.0,Syrah,Mulvane Wine Co.,"Addictive aromas of hot blackberry pie laced with cinnamon, allspice, cola nut and a stewed cherry sauce reveal the promise of this popular Los Alamos Valley vineyard. Dark plum fruit, but with the acidity of the plum skin, meets with candied flavors of blackberry syrup and the freshness of soda water. A hedonistic Syrah."
Portugal,93,41.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança,"Almost ready to drink, this wood-aged wine is packed with herbs, dark berry fruits and the first signs of secondary spice and leather flavors. The tannins are still powerful and need to soften further, so drink this complex, concentrated wine from 2016."
US,93,48.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Double Canyon,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe."
US,93,200.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek,"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020."
US,93,39.0,Petit Verdot,Côtes de Ciel,"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated."
US,93,62.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman,"Principally Klipsun vineyard fruit, this is a mass of black cherry and cassis, wreathed in smoke from aging in 80% new French barrels. Great balance and length carry it through into drying tannins. A perfect steakhouse Cabernet."
Italy,93,43.0,Nebbiolo,Punset,"Structured and energetic, this has a balsamic nose that offers aromas of menthol, mint, fennel, ripe berry, leather and a whiff of violet. The palate delivers crushed red cherry, black raspberry, baking spices and licorice alongside assertive tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2017–2025."
France,92,35.0,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart,"This ripe, full wine has both great minerality and rich white fruits that are aromatic as well as very fresh. The fruits are laced with citrus to give a complex wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,48.0,Riesling,Domaine Zinck,"Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed. It is rounded and opulent while preserving the steely, mineral texture. Still young, it demands aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,55.0,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now."
Portugal,92,40.0,Portuguese Red,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,"Produced from old vines, this is an impressive wine, rich and dense. It brings together dark tannins and opulent black fruits that cushion the firm structure. A lively acidity and a silky character show that the wine is ready to drink."
Italy,92,69.0,Nebbiolo,Fontanafredda,"This opens with a pretty fragrance of violet, exotic spice and perfumed berry. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground pepper, mocha and anisette. It's nicely balanced with fresh acidity and firm but polished tannins."
France,88,16.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Chantemerle,"Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016."
France,88,16.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Chaubinet,"While the wine is rich, it's also very crisp and fruity. Tight acidity and a chalky, steely texture are balanced by ripe apples and pink grapefruit. It's a wine for drinking this year, bright and fruity."
France,88,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Ferran,"A tight and herbaceous wine that is crisp, mineral and fresh. It shows a great potential for fruitiness, with natural juicy acidity as well as a bright, aromatic aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
France,88,15.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fongalan,"Round and velvet smooth, it has blackberry fruits that are full in the mouth, giving freshness while also making the wine rich and generous. The tannins are already well-integrated into this soft wine. Drink from 2015."
France,88,13.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Mezain,"Crisp and deliciously fruity, this is lively and bright. Acidity points up the lime and grapefruit flavors, leaving a fresh, juicy aftertaste. Drink now for maximum pleasure."
US,88,28.0,Chardonnay,Clos du Val,"Full-bodied and resplendent in ripe apple and brioche, this well-crafted wine is layered and smooth. It would pair well with grilled salmon or herb-roasted chicken."
US,88,36.0,Pinot Noir,Coeur de Terre,"Toasty scents and flavors of the barrels (40% new) cloak tart raspberry fruit. It's clean and efficient, though for the moment at least, the barrel flavors outrun the rather light fruit. That can change over time, so give this one until 2015 or so in bottle."
Romania,88,9.0,Rosé,Cramele Halewood,"This playful pink has fun aromas of cinnamon, red berry and bubble gum that lead to flavors of sour cherry and red plum on the palate. The finish is big, fruity and generous."
US,88,24.0,Chardonnay,Daniel Gehrs,"Bright orange juice, dill herbs and a slight whiff of vanilla bean lead the aromas on this un-oaked Chard. On the palate, flavors of apple cider come with a wash of fresh lime juice on the back end."
US,88,30.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Davis Family,"This white combines 48% Roussanne with 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier to creamy, tropical effect, its balance between ripe melon and pear fruitiness and spiced acidity well woven. From one of the few sources of some of these grapes in the Russian River Valley, this Rhône-inspired wine is ready to pair with lobster or a roast turkey dinner."
US,88,25.0,Merlot,Decoy,"Taking time to come around aromatically, it opens up with plum and bright red cherry fruit that follow on the palate, a touch of savory tobacco suggested around the tannins. On the finish expect a balance of spice and sweet as black pepper and caramel compete for affection."
Italy,88,34.0,Nebbiolo,Reversanti,"Made for early drinking, this bright wine delivers red berry fruit lightly accented with sage and baking spices. It's not an ager so enjoy now through 2020."
US,88,60.0,Pinot Noir,Roco,"Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish."
US,88,54.0,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury,"The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs."
US,88,15.0,Muscat,Silvan Ridge,"This is a frizzante style of Muscat, the pressure slight enough to allow for a screwcap seal. Off-dry, spicy and aromatic, it's a great sipping wine, with concentrated flavors of sweet orange-pekoe tea."
Italy,88,56.0,Nebbiolo,Silvano Bolmida,"This opens with aromas of black plum, oak, espresso, black pepper, balsamic notes and a whiff of barnyard. The bracing palate delivers crushed dark cherry alongside oak sensations of espresso, toast and vanilla. Aggressive wood tannins cut this short and give an astringent finish."
US,88,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Supéry,"The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine. An ideal wine for summer or whenever one needs to recall a summer's day."
US,88,61.0,Pinot Noir,Testarossa,"Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge."
Italy,88,46.0,Nebbiolo,Trediberri,"Black plum, chocolate-covered cherry and mocha sensations come together alongside forceful tannins. It's rather ripe and forward for the vintage. Drink 2018–2025."
Spain,88,30.0,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes,"This is brilliantly purple in color, with jumpy, untamed black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it is tannic and clawing, with a cheek-drilling mouthfeel. Syrupy blackberry flavors offer baking spice and clove accents, while the finish is showing unabsorbed oak and monster tannins."
Spain,88,17.0,Tempranillo Blend,Yuntero,"Dusty black cherry and dark plum aromas are ripe and friendly. This is a plump, modern-style red with a clean mouthfeel and weight. Berry fruits, spice and oak flavors blend well, while the finish is, in general, full, smooth and adequately fresh. Tempranillo with 10% Petit Verdot."
France,88,,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,Musset-Roullier,"This fresh and fruity sparkling wine is crisp with apple skin and apricot flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth , it has a lightly creamy mousse. The blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay gives delicious fruitiness and tight final acidity."
US,88,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Oso Libre,"Chalky earth, black pepper and clove comprise the nose on this wine, which gets a boost from 10% Merlot. The flavors are spicy and complex, with cedar, tea and a tiny bit of varietally distinct green pepper."
US,88,39.0,Red Blend,Oso Libre,"Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors."
Italy,88,49.0,Nebbiolo,Palladino,"Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish."
France,88,23.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Pierre Prieur et Fils,"A lemon-scented, crisp wine, it's also full of ripe yellow fruits. It's a warm in style, rich with both fruit and an open texture. Almonds and acidity give a refreshing aftertaste."
US,88,16.0,Pinot Grigio,Bargetto,"This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass. There is a slightly peachy, bubblegum character once sipped, with lemon-lime soda in the midpalate and a flinty, gunmetal finish."
US,88,32.0,Mourvèdre,Adelaida,"A brighter, more mineral- and acid-driven take on the often rustic Rhône grape, this kicks off with fresh smells of raspberry and rock. The palate brings tart cherry, followed by just-ripe black berry and really ripe raspberry on the midpalate, and a tartness on the finish."
US,88,18.0,Chardonnay,Alma Rosa,"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors."
Argentina,88,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamadrid,"Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity. Flavors of baked black fruits, fig paste, chocolate and herbs follow the nose, as does a chocolaty, rich  finish. Drink through 2016."
France,92,92.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine de Bellene,"Packed with tannin, it is not showing much sign of fruit yet. It is dark, brooding and very firm in texture, with just with a hint of juicy black cherry flavors. Wait until 2017 before drinking."
France,92,94.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"A very fruity wine, it shows rich wood flavors as well as equally rich fruit. It is complex, very mineral in character, tight and nervy. The citrus fruit is matched by the apricot flavor, putting down layers of acidity. Don't drink before 2017."
US,92,58.0,Chardonnay,Failla,"The southern Napa Coombsville area is near San Pablo Bay, making it a cool area. In this vintage, it shows the acidity and mineraity of its terroir, but also the ripeness Chardonnay can achieve in a good vineyard, with orange and apricot flavors enhanced with oak. Drink now."
US,92,50.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gallica,"From the estimable Shake Ridge Ranch, winemaker Rosemary Cakebread has fashioned a lovely blend from 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Opening with leathery tannins, the rich and savory concoction imparts juicy dark plum, tobacco and especially coffee."
US,92,48.0,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,"The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal."
US,92,32.0,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs,"This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020."
Italy,92,27.0,Pinot Bianco,Nals Margreid,"This wine has more structure and depth than most Pinot Biancos from Alto Adige, thanks to vineyard location and 20% aging in large casks. It delivers sensations of apples and exotic fruit along with a flinty note. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity."
Portugal,92,35.0,Alvarinho,Provam,"Pure Alvarinho from the Monção region, it's rich, creamy and textured. Lined with great acidity, it also has intense apple, bitter orange and a strongly herbal element. While it's ready to drink, this complex wine will benefit by waiting until 2015."
Portugal,92,95.0,Portuguese White,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,"This wood-aged wine comes from a small parcel of old vines in the Quinta Nova vineyard. With its ripe, smooth and creamy texture, it has a full, almost Burgundian feel. Ripe peach combines with vanilla to make a wine that has concentration and richness, cut with final acidity."
US,92,43.0,Pinot Noir,Ryan Cochrane,"A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley. The vintage was difficult, but the wine is rich in raspberry, cranberry and persimmon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity and finishing totally dry. There's no reason not to drink it now."
Italy,92,33.0,Garganega,Suavia,"Here's a delicious Soave with depth and character. Floral aromas of Spanish Broom and chamomile take center stage, accented by a smidge of exotic fruit and graphite. The juicy palate offers honeydew melon, white peach, ripe pear, citrus and mineral purity balanced by fresh acidity."
Italy,92,60.0,Sauvignon,Cantina Terlano,"Classic varietal aromas include stone fruit, crushed tomato vine, freshly cut grass and green melon. The palate offers a depth of flavors that include creamy white peach and ripe cantaloupe that are brightened by firm acidity. It closes on a flinty mineral note."
France,92,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre,"The estate wine from Château du Cèdre is anything but simple. A powerful series of tannins and dense black fruits offer both a dark texture and great fruitiness. Acidity comes through strongly and, with the tannins, promises aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,30.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve,"The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017."
US,92,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Communication Block,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond."
US,92,35.0,Syrah,Baker & Brain,"Right out of the bottle, this 100% Syrah delights for its overall balance and deep, rich array of cherries and blueberries. If you pay attention, you'll find more complex layers of sautéed wild mushrooms, grilled prosciutto and toast. Dry and tannic, and would be ideal with roasted lamb."
France,91,60.0,Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene,"There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink."
France,91,16.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine D'en Ségur,"Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017."
France,91,40.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,"This is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It is already finely balanced, rich with toast, apricot fruits and a tight, mineral character. It is enjoyable now but will age well until 2022."
US,91,60.0,Pinot Noir,Elk Cove,"Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity. Entry is surprisingly soft, and (perhaps influenced by the name) there seems to be a pleasing clay-like quality to the mouthfeel. Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish."
France,91,100.0,Pinot Noir,Evening Land,"Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2017."
Portugal,91,18.0,Touriga Nacional,Herdade de São Miguel,"Violets, truffles and ripe black fruits are present in this structured wine. It has almost too much richness, but there is plenty to admire. Solid tannins, a dark, heavy texture and complex acidity all show aging potential. Drink from 2018."
US,91,16.0,Pinot Gris,Iris Vineyards,"Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish."
US,91,42.0,Syrah,Jack Creek,"This is a gigantic Syrah, a tsunami of blackberry jam and milk chocolate, with headier notes of cassis liqueur and toasty buttered oak. That sounds sweet, but the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are thick, but finely ground and negotiable now. It might last in the bottle for many years, but there's no point in aging it. Enjoy now with elaborate roasts and stews."
France,91,,Gros and Petit Manseng,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"A ripe, wood-aged wine, it's richly smoky and fruity at the same time. The blend brings out honey, ripe apricots and peach. Acidity cuts through at the end to give a final, delicious lift. Drink now, but best wait until 2015."
US,91,20.0,Pinot Noir,Brick & Mortar,"The hue is an elegant peach just starting to blush with pink. The wine is entirely dry, with low alcohol framing intricate flavors of peaches, limes and vanilla, brightened by crisp acidity."
Italy,91,25.0,Sauvignon,Colterenzio,"A savory Sauvignon with intensity and balance, it has aromas of cantaloupe and crushed tomato vine. The vibrant palate offers juicy green melon, pineapple and citrus together with a mineral note. Fresh acidity leaves a clean, crisp finish."
Italy,91,23.0,Pinot Grigio,Colterenzio,"This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity."
US,91,38.0,Pinot Noir,Cuvaison,"With a light, silky mouthfeel and mouthwatering acidity, this Pinot satisfies for its rich array of raspberries, cherries, spices, cola and smoky oak. It defines the Carneros style: tart, a little earthy and ageworthy. Drink now–2019."
US,91,32.0,Zinfandel,De Loach,"De Loach continues to impress with this Lake County vineyard-designate, a well-balanced Zin with plenty of density amid its brick tar and brambly blackberry fruit. With leveled acidity along with plenty of power, it'll both age and be pleasing to drink now, with smoky meats."
US,94,60.0,Syrah,Saviah,"This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention."
US,94,30.0,Riesling,Smith-Madrone,"Entirely estate grown from dry-farmed grapes, this white sparkles with waxy apricot and pear flavors and crisp, underlying mineral stoniness. Dry, with refreshing acidity, it doesn't skimp on mouthfeel, delivering a viscosity that's invitingly complex and lingering."
Italy,94,85.0,Red Blend,Speri,"This complex and fragrant wine opens with dried violet, black plum and cooking spice aromas. The smooth, well-structured palate doles out blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, ripe black cherry, nutmeg and licorice flavors. Velvety tannins provide elegant support. Drink through 2027."
US,94,30.0,Riesling,Stony Hill,"From a combination of dry-farmed estate fruit and grapes sourced in Carneros, this lovely white is fermented in stainless steel, which coaxes a seamless, light-bodied crispness on the palate. Exotic white peach and briny stone highlight a heady aromatic thread of honeysuckle, ginger and wild vanilla."
US,94,65.0,Pinot Noir,Testarossa,"Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways."
New Zealand,94,57.0,Chardonnay,Kumeu River,"Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025. Hickory smoke outlines white peach before ending in a long flurry of lime zest."
US,94,90.0,Pinot Noir,Bergström,"The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb."
US,94,85.0,Pinot Noir,Black Kite,"Consistently outstanding Pinot Noir producer Black Kite has done it again. This bottling comes together in a seamless symphony of aromas and flavors. Ripe fruit, subtly spicy oak and forest floor notes fill the glass. Its opulent texture unfolds into layers of baking spice, earthiness, and red and black cherry fruit, with a long, complex finish."
US,94,70.0,Pinot Noir,Blue Farm,"Powerful tannin meets subdued fruit in this layered, youthful wine. Concentrated and focused, with rose petal, sage and wild strawberry notes, it holds back teasingly before slowly unraveling to reveal velvety texture and corpulent weight."
US,94,70.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene,"There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish."
US,94,60.0,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell,"From the famous site on Westside Road outside of Healdsburg, this bold red shows orange, dark cherry and pungent earth scents, remaining savory at its core. Medium-bodied and balanced with acidity, it takes on a meaty persona seasoned with pepper, clove and black tea."
Italy,94,38.0,Garganega,Gini,"Elegant and savory, this vibrant white offers enticing Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit, wet stone and crushed thyme aromas. The vibrant, ethereal palate carries subtle, tantalizing layers of yellow peach, tangy tangerine, lemon drop and pineapple with lively acidity. A graphite note closes the lingering finish. Too elegant for some palates, it shows impressive balance and depth, despite the cool, wet vintage."
Italy,94,29.0,Garganega,Gini,"Hands down one of Italy's best whites, this boasts alluring white flower and yellow stone fruit scents. The enveloping, delicious palate delivers white peach, mature pear, ginger and lemon drop flavors. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a mineral note energizes the finish."
US,94,155.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Parallel,"This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023–2033."
US,94,48.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"This gorgeous wine deftly integrates a lively mix of currant, cherry, breakfast tea and dried leaves into a seamless and seductive whole. Produced from vines dating back to the early 1970s, it finishes with a delicious streak of milk chocolate. Drink now through 2030."
US,94,95.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia,"From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish."
US,94,80.0,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg,"This pretty, floral wine made entirely from Chardonnay grapes from this site is both creamy and crisp. It offers impressive length, acidity and stoniness, accenting its focused green apple flavor. As it opens, it takes on a richer honey-like tone that adds further complexity and deliciousness."
US,94,49.0,Pinot Noir,Trisaetum,"Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030."
France,94,35.0,Tannat-Cabernet,Vignobles Brumont,"The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften. Drink from 2020."
US,94,50.0,Syrah,Waters,"The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background. The palate is surprisingly fruit forward, with plum and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish glides for a full 30 seconds."
France,94,44.0,Provence red blend,Domaine de la Bégude,"This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourvèdre. The wine is produced from organically grown grapes, giving purity as well as some serious structure in the background. Drink from 2018."
Spain,94,68.0,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega Classica,"Spicy yet sweet aromas of sarsaparilla root, saddle leather and earthy berry fruits precede a rich dense palate. This tastes of dark cherry and berry fruit, with an herbal shading adding complexity. Chocolaty oak takes hold on a solid long finish. Drink through 2024."
France,94,20.0,Rosé,Château Vignelaure,"This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017."
Spain,94,,Red Blend,Matarromera,"Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins. Drink through 2030."
US,94,95.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellet Estate,"This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time. Red-fruit driven, it's round and rich, with moderate tannin and cassis, clove and black pepper highlights."
France,94,44.0,Provence red blend,Domaine de la Bégude,"This is an impressively rich, still very young wine. Dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre grape, it is dense and concentrated. Spice and dark red fruits are shot through with a wonderful herbal character that conjures the southern warmth. The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019."
Argentina,94,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso,"Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023."
France,94,100.0,Rosé,Château d'Esclans,"This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink."
France,94,70.0,Malbec,Château Lagrézette,"From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021."
US,94,63.0,Chardonnay,Ponzi,"Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging."
Italy,91,75.0,Nebbiolo,Fratelli Alessandria,"Scents of woodland berry, rose petal, grilled herb, anisette and a balsamic note emerge on this firmly structured wine. On the robust palate, white pepper, licorice, sage and a hint of toast weave through the black cherry core. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink 2018–2028."
Germany,91,23.0,Riesling,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium,"Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett. Invigorating acidity lends backbone and a steely focus that resonates long on the finish. It's beautiful now, but should hold nicely, and perhaps improve, through 2020."
US,91,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Galerie,"Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality."
Spain,91,22.0,Albariño,Granbazán,"Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents. This is pure and lifted by fine acidity, while flavors of apple, pineapple and lemon-lime end fresh, with a distant note of citrus pith. Drink immediately."
US,91,45.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Grieve,"From the Lovall Valley section of the Napa Valley quite near Sonoma, this lovely wine is awash in tropical mango, with lilts of pear and vanilla. Creamy, it's made in a fuller-bodied style but never gets ridiculous, instead offering balance and elegance, finishing with a squeeze of grapefruit."
Portugal,91,130.0,Alicante Bouschet,Herdade do Rocim,"The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density. Dark and brooding, it is super everything and certainly needs to calm down. Drink from 2019."
US,91,38.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Jada Vineyard & Winery,"There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas. The palate is more restrained and quite grippy, with flavors of green-apple skins, Bosc pear and a touch of honey."
US,91,30.0,Pinot Noir,La Crema,"This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate. The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets. You'll find it hard to keep from gulping this by the glassful."
US,91,22.0,Syrah,Lawer,"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility."
Italy,91,,Nebbiolo,Le Strette,"Aromas of slightly stewed fruit, steeped berry, spice and menthol unfold in the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and a mint note while bracing tannins and racy acidity provide the backbone. This needs a few more years to calm down and will continue to age well for a decade or more. Drink 2018–2026."
Italy,91,90.0,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"Pretty aromas of blue flower, rose, wild berry and graphite lead the way. The firm palate delivers mature black cherry, raspberry, star anise, black pepper and chopped sage alongside bright acidity and tightly knit tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2026."
US,91,60.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michael Mondavi Family Estate,"Bittersweet at first, with sizable tannins, this Cab also contains 13.8% Petit Verdot. Red and black berries give it a juicy palate atop dusty, chalky tannins and a richness of leather and clove on the finish."
Italy,91,115.0,Nebbiolo,Oddero,"Aromas of perfumed berry, mint, baking spice and a whiff of oak emerge on this structured wine. The firm palate offers wild red cherry, crushed raspberry, mint, grilled sage and a touch of oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins and nervous acidity. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2019–2031."
US,91,55.0,Pinot Noir,Small Vines,"Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021."
Portugal,91,30.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Terras de Alter,"A classic northern Rhône valley blend of Syrah with a touch of Viognier, this massive wine is made from grapes grown on granite soil, which leaves its mark in dense minerality and great power. It is a wine for lovers of the big stuff, concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018."
Portugal,91,14.0,Aragonês,Terras de Alter,"This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste."
US,91,48.0,Chardonnay,Testarossa,"Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery. Pencil lead kicks off the palate, which then opens into poached apples and lemon oil, laid across a sizzling acidity that lasts long."
US,91,40.0,Chardonnay,Thomas George,"Lemony and light on entry, this tropically kissed, textured white develops body and weight over time, finding a balance and elegance that's hard to ignore. A touch of white peach wraps up the finish."
Germany,91,39.0,Silvaner,Thörle,"Often herbal and a bit green in nature, Silvaner is a much maligned grape. Yet at Thörle, it seems to blossom into something perfumed and quite fruity, redolent of peaches and fresh pears. Characteristic herb notes are fresh and nuanced, highlighted against brisk citrus and apple flavors and a silken supple mouthfeel."
Italy,91,60.0,Nebbiolo,Vite Colte,"Engaging aromas of red rose, iris, wild berry, cinnamon and a balsamic note waft out of the glass while juicy cherry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint drive the spicy, polished palate. Firm but refined tannins provide structure. Drink 2017–2021."
US,91,50.0,Chardonnay,Wedell Cellars,"Caramelized white peach, salted lemon, pear skin, red apple and the hint of white flowers show on the nose of this wine by these longtime but under-the-radar producers. The palate blends orange skins and grapefruit pith with buttered toast, sea salt and a dill-like herb character."
US,91,48.0,Pinot Noir,Winderlea,"A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines."
France,91,54.0,Chardonnay,A.R. Lenoble ,"This is a very lively wine with a creamy mousse. The wine is towards dry, bringing out great white and citrus fruit flavors with a burst of tangy acidity. It comes from the village of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, which gives the wine a tight mineral texture at the end."
Portugal,91,42.0,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,"A Garrafeira wine is a special selection and this wine, which was aged for 30 months after bottling before being released, shows its quality quickly. Now reaching drinkability, its tannins have softened leaving rich full black currant and fresh acidity along with a more mature leathery character. Drink now and until 2020."
US,91,50.0,Sparkling Blend,Argyle,"Principally Pinot Noir, the blend includes 25% Pinot Meunier and a splash of Chardonnay. It's a light and pretty salmon pink in hue, with hints of honeysuckle and moist earth in the nose. Flavors suggest tart raspberries and Bing cherries, with impressive minerality in the crisp, lingering finish."
Israel,91,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bazelet HaGolan,"Restrained aromas of black plum barely set the stage for flavors of dark plum, cherry-vanilla, mint eucalyptus and ground black pepper. Fruit flavors are soft, but the minty notes never overpower brightness and acidity. Tannins are just shy of opulent, and the finish is marked by a note of tart apple crispness."
US,91,40.0,Chardonnay,Bernardus,"Creamy on the nose, this wine shows seared pineapple, apple custard, lemon oil and faint iodine aromas. The flavors are evenly placed between lemon yogurt and salted apples, mixing a bit of tang and ripe fruit with a savory sea salt."
US,91,42.0,Pinot Noir,Big Table Farm,"Lush aromatics conjure up dreams of strawberry cream. This is quite pretty, with perfect balance among its components of fruit, acid and tannin, set comfortably in a compact frame."
Italy,91,85.0,Nebbiolo,Icardi,"Enticing aromas of crushed rose, red berry, wild mint, menthol and a hint of oak come together. The linear, focused palate offers raw red cherry, strawberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped sage accompanied by tightly knit, close-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2019–2026."
Spain,91,32.0,Tempranillo,Matarromera,"Ripe berry aromas blend nicely with earthy leathery scents. With a full and easy palate, this generous Crianza delivers blackberry and chocolate flavors that veer toward raisin and prune, especially on the finish, which is lightly toasted and dense in feel. Drink through 2019."
US,90,41.0,Red Blend,Le Vigne,"Cedar, cherry, black olive, wet earth, green olive and freshly plucked plum pop on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of ripe black cherry down the middle, but is surrounded by a tangy green olive and an underripe-berry character, whose tartness enlivens the mouth."
US,90,27.0,Ugni Blanc,Paix Sur Terre,"One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture."
US,90,29.0,Grüner Veltliner,Reustle,"Much like its companion from the Revelation & Sorek Bloc, this offers well-endowed flavors of melon and white peach, along with a touch of citrus. There is a sense of higher acidity, along with lower listed alcohol, rather counter-intuitive as this is the reserve. Pick either one and you'll be pleased."
France,90,33.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Bott-Geyl,"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game."
France,90,70.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Faiveley,"This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels. It is solid and firm while also having great swathes of raspberries and red plums laced together with acidity. The aftertaste is perfumed with a fresh lift. Drink from 2018"
US,90,19.0,Pinot Noir,Pike Road,This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins. The immaculate craftsmanship and clean direct flavors are light years beyond budget Pinot Noir from most other regions. This is your perfect salmon wine.
Italy,90,22.0,Frappato,Planeta,"Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors and energizes the finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018."
Germany,90,25.0,Lemberger,Schnaitmann,"Ruddy black plums and blackberries scent this lusciously ripe, rich Lemberger. It's irresistibly fruity, yet anchored by a savory edge of bramble and dried herb along with crisp cranberry acidity freshening the finish. Drink now through 2021."
France,90,27.0,Sylvaner,Domaine Ostertag,"Translucent, fresh aromatics, like green pears glimpsed through clear water, characterize this wine. There's also an herbal edge of fresh, green foliage on this slender and refreshing wine. The limpid purity is very convincing."
France,90,22.0,Chasselas,Domaine Schoffit,"The slightest whiff of pepper on the nose leads to a spiced, leesy and slender palate on this unusual Alsace resident: it's Switzerland's Chasselas making an appearance. This is slender and while the nose is shy, the palate provides ample textures. Make as a local and have this with fresh white asparagus. The wine has a great acidic spine and luminous freshness."
France,90,30.0,Alsace white blend,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The nose is like pear juice spilled onto warm earth, while the palate is more citrus-focused. A seam of almost tropical acidity links lemon to notes of pineapple, lifted by joyful freshness."
US,90,15.0,Pinot Gris,Firesteed,"Fresh cut pear fruit flavors carry this wine. It's crisp and clean, with fresh fruit balanced against natural acidity. Drink it now while the freshness is paramount."
US,90,45.0,Pinot Noir,The Eyrie Vineyards,"Planted with eight grapes, including the three Pinot “sisters”—Blanc, Gris and Noir—this site is located just below Archery Summit in the heart of the Dundee Hills. The pale, pretty rosé hue introduces this most elegant and restrained of the winery's vineyard selections. It's a velvety, finesse wine, with delicate flavors of rhubarb, cinnamon, cardamom and cocoa."
France,90,80.0,Pinot Noir,Albert Bichot,"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019."
Italy,90,,White Blend,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"Enticing scents of spring flower, beeswax and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The elegant, linear palate shows juicy lemon, nectarine, hazelnut and a saline note framed in firm acidity. It closes crisp and clean."
Italy,90,,White Blend,Occhipinti,"Made with 60% Moscato di Alessandria and 40% Albanello, this earthy, intriguing white offers penetrating aromas of pressed wild flower, vineyard dust, orchard fruit and dried aromatic herb. The pervasive floral scent follows through to the mineral-driven palate along with dried peach, candied nectarine zest and chopped sage. Quality has improved immensely since the producer transferred to her spacious new cellars."
US,90,18.0,Albariño,J. Scott Cellars,"Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white."
Italy,90,19.0,Greco,Villa Raiano,"Lightly scented, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of aromatic herb. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, mature green apple and a hint of nectarine while a mineral note fills in the juicy finish."
Germany,90,31.0,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch),"Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett. It offers uncomplicated refreshment, but is anchored with taut acidity and honed, steely minerality. The finish is long and persistent."
US,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hahn,"A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms."
US,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lyeth,"An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019."
US,90,24.0,Merlot,Napa Cellars,"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering."
US,90,80.0,Red Blend,Paraduxx,"From a valley-floor site, this blend of 70% Zinfandel and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon delights in a depth of blackberry and cedar, reflecting well on both varieties. Firm tannin and restrained oak provide room for a touch of gun smoke and pencil lead, with a lengthy finish."
Spain,90,35.0,Tempranillo,Quintana de Cue,"Aromas of plum, wild herbs and tobacco are mature and suggest that this is ready to drink. In the mouth, this is medium-bodied, with clarity and a sense of freshness. Plum, berry and cherry flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020."
Germany,90,40.0,Früburgunder,Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoss-Altenahr,"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now."
Spain,90,28.0,Tempranillo,Casa del Valle,"Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019."
US,90,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey,"From several vineyard sites and combining all five red Bordeaux varieties, this wine is fermented in stainless steel before it rests over two years in both French and American oak. Powerful, it retains an elegance amid a tannic, grippy entry of toasted oak and black cherry, and a rich textured finish accented in cinnamon and chocolate."
US,90,28.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joleté,"Grippy leather and tobacco provide a gravelly texture and burly nature to this medium-bodied wine, which finds its groove in the glass. Concentrated and dense, it offers smoother elements of black currant, cassis and leather on the finish."
US,90,36.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Prospect 772,"A deep color and oodles of blackberry and boysenberry flavors lend a lot of impact to this full-bodied, ripe and almost jammy-tasting wine. It is generous, layered and concentrated but not overly serious in terms of tannins. Call it big but friendly."
US,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boatique,"Seductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California. Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly."
US,90,50.0,Chardonnay,Hearst Ranch,"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable."
US,90,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hunt Cellars,"Juicy blackberry and blackcurrant mix with cocoa, cola and peppercorns on the nose of this densely layered wine. Flavors are deep and dark with tar, pencil shavings, dried blueberry, street asphalt and a strong umami character, still tightly wound at five years old. Let it breathe, or wait another couple years for optimal drinking."
Italy,90,60.0,Sangiovese,La Fiorita,"Tilled earth, ripe dark-skinned berry, leather and menthol aromas show this wine's Sangiovese pedigree. The robust, concentrated palate doles out crushed black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol—the latter a common characteristic of this hot vintage. Firm, ripe tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017–2021."
US,90,46.0,Malbec,Merry Cellars,Aromas of fresh dill and other green herbs leap up from the glass. The plum flavors are pure and persistent. It's a unique expression of the variety.
Canada,90,70.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mission Hill,"This Bordeaux-style blend is comprised of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors of raspberry and blackberry are light and tangy, the tannins mellow. A note of dark chocolate highlights the finish."
Spain,90,26.0,Albariño,Palacio de Fefiñanes,"Apple, lime and mineral aromas lend freshness to a mature nose. This feels round and plump, but well balanced due to fine acidity. Peach and citrus flavors are stony and finish with tropical notes of lychee and mango. Drink now."
France,90,,Pinot Noir,Pascal & Nicolas Reverdy,"This is a finely perfumed wine, rich in both structure and ripe fruits. It is smoothly textured, a full-bodied wine that has dark cherry flavors as well as a balanced layer of acidity. The wine is still young, juicy and will develop further, so drink from 2017."
Italy,90,60.0,Sangiovese,Piccini,"Aromas of underbrush, charred earth, truffle, star anise and a hint of menthol come together in the glass. The ripe palate shows dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside solid, assertive tannins. Drink 2019–2025."
Italy,90,75.0,Sangiovese,Pietranera,"Aromas of espresso, underbrush, leather, dark spice, mature black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of oak lead the way. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, vanilla and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a dusty finish."
Moldova,90,32.0,White Blend,Purcari,"Aromas of lemon custard and pineapple are well-balanced in this blend of 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc and the desert-them doesn't stop, as this white offers the palate a medley of crème brûlée, vanilla bean and lemon meringue pie."
Italy,90,95.0,Sangiovese,Renieri,"The aromas that come together are those of scorched earth, grilled porcini, roasted coffee bean and a bit of burnt rubber. The mature palate offers dried cherry, blackberry confiture, mocha, vanilla and a hint of game alongside tongue-drying tannins that clench the finish. Give this a few years to unfold then drink sooner rather than later."
Italy,90,60.0,Sangiovese,Podere Scopetone,"Grilled herb, forest floor, scorched earth, cured meat and menthol aromas lead the way. The ripe palate offers juicy wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and a confectionary note alongside firm, enveloping tannins. It's already accessible and will make fine near- to mid-term drinking."
Italy,90,70.0,Sangiovese,Sesta di Sopra,"Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins."
US,90,20.0,White Blend,Carlson,"The nose on this creative blend of 52% Gewürztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels."
France,90,27.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château Pégau,"Sourced from 50+ year-old vines in the commune of Sorgues, this aromatic blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre boasts hints of rosemary, bay leaf and clove. It's reasonably full bodied, with a long, drying finish that demands another year or two in the cellar or (preferably) some rare beef or lamb."
France,90,20.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Kirkland Signature,"This Costco brand has become a reliable source for bargain Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This vintage is a bit firmer and more tannic than others, but it still weaves together cherry and leather notes into a pleasing whole. It might need a year or two to soften, but it should provide good drinking through 2025."
US,90,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Medlock Ames,"Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot are included in this wine that's black-purple in color, with a thick density to its dusty black fruit. Cedar, tar and tobacco weave in between blackberry and currant, finishing in a powerful grip of tannin."
US,90,28.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Passaggio,"A minuscule amount of this wine was made, all of it fermented entirely in stainless steel. The result is lively in mouthcoating acidity and refreshing swirls of light-bodied mandarin orange and lime."
US,90,60.0,Chardonnay,Patland,"Grapes are sourced from both Stagecoach and Hyde vineyards in this wine that takes its time in the glass coming around. Funky brine and a tropical flourish open on the nose with a severity of oak that mellows slowly. Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare."
US,90,22.0,Chardonnay,Trig Point,"Tropical guava and mango surround a restrained cradling of French oak, only 15% of it new, in this easy-to-like, approachable wine. Wrappings of vanilla and honeysuckle complete the picture, with a straightforward, relatively lengthy finish."
Spain,90,49.0,White Blend,Valquejigoso,"The first thing that leaps at you on this oddball blend of Albillo, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier is toasty oak, which overrides spice and apple aromas. In the mouth, this is full, resiny and grabby. Oak-driven flavors of vanilla, lees, peach and white pepper finish long, with elegance and a woody aftertaste."
Hungary,90,35.0,Kekfrankos,Weninger,"This well-balanced wine has scents of finely ground black pepper, dried cherry, black plum and violets with flavors of plum, blackberry and tart cherry. The tannins are smooth and the finish is persistent."
Italy,90,90.0,Sangiovese,Tenuta di Sesta,"Aromas of wild berry, thyme and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose on this structured red while the full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper, sage and anise. Tightly wound tannins provide framework. Give it a few years to unfurl then drink up."
US,90,30.0,Chardonnay,Terlato,"Caramelized oak makes a statement in this wine that starts out richly and roundly, but finds a sense of balanced acidity in the glass. Medium bodied, it features classic notes of Meyer lemon and Gravenstein apple."
US,90,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Calling,"This straightforward wine shows an exuberance of toasted oak and grip at first before relaxing into its more mannered self, a twist of cedar and sage giving it a classic sensibility. Cassis and black cherry take on more power on the full-bodied palate, exhibiting the soft approachability of the appellation."
US,90,38.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Westwood,"Given about a year in French oak, less than half of it new, this is a cohesive blend of 53% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 6% Counoise. It's brawny in meat and leather, blackberry and tar, with a velvety mouthfeel benefiting from integrated oak."
US,90,22.0,Tempranillo,Fenestra,"This flavorful and beautifully contoured wine is simply delicious. It has a lightly spicy aroma, plenty of fresh red-cherry and plum flavors, moderate acidity and tannins, and medium body."
Italy,90,30.0,Sangiovese,Castello di Bossi,"Round and ripe, this opens with aromas that recall baked plum, vanilla, anise and a whiff of leather. The approachable, juicy palate doles out mature black cherry, blackberry, mocha, dried sage, baking spice and licorice. Polished, fine-grained tannins provide support."
Italy,90,32.0,Red Blend,Cecchi,"Forest floor, black plum, menthol and a whiff of exotic spice unfold on this elegantly structured wine. The precise palate offers mature black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and hint of chewing tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019."
Italy,90,35.0,Sangiovese,Cafaggio,"Scorched earth, underbrush, blue flower and woodland berry are some of the scents you'll find on this focused wine. The elegant, full-bodied palate delivers black raspberry, mature cherry, brown kitchen spice and a hint of leather alongside tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2021."
US,87,36.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dussek Family Cellars,"Though just four years old, this wine seems advanced with notes of dried cherry, vanilla, dried tobacco and blackberry. The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins."
US,87,30.0,Zinfandel,League of Rogues,"Lighter in color than many other bottlings, this shows cherry and pepper spice on a somewhat reserved nose. But that light color unleashes a lush and ripe palate, with red berries, nutmeg and game flavors showing most prominently."
US,87,20.0,Cabernet Franc,Serenity,"Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms."
US,87,32.0,Grenache,Sol Stone,"The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins."
Spain,87,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca,"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor."
Spain,87,27.0,Tempranillo,Trus,"Raspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up."
US,87,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Va Piano,"A first release, this wine offers light suggestions of red apple, herbs and tropical fruit. It's medium bodied yet leaner in style with tart acids but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Les Hauts de Tousquiron,"This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016."
US,87,30.0,Chardonnay,McGrail,"This presents a big, buttery, bold style, with no apologies for the full body and ripe fruit surrounded by toasty, oaky aromas and flavors. This is dry, rich in texture, and more savory or smoky rather than fruity."
US,87,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michael David,"Heavy aromas and flavors of oak and smoke accompany ripe black cherry and boysenberry for a rich mixture. This wine is deeply colored, full bodied and pumped up with the flavors of heavily toasted oak. A firm but not harsh texture accompanies the almost sweet taste of all that oak."
US,87,23.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards,"This wine offers notes of Red Hots, coffee, vanilla and herbs. Cherry and blackberry flavors are sweet and viscous in feel backed by dry tannins."
US,87,22.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Cairdeas,"This blend of Marsanne (32%), Grenache Blanc (27%), Roussanne (24%), Picpoul (14%) and Viognier starts out reduced before opening to offer pear, peach, mineral and almond. It's medium bodied in feel."
Italy,87,75.0,Sangiovese,Citille di Sopra,"Earthy aromas include new leather, scorched soil, wild berry and a touch of funky game. On the robust palate, grilled sage, tobacco and licorice add depth to a core of fleshy wild cherry along a backbone of raspy tannins and searing alcohol. Drink after 2018."
Italy,87,98.0,Sangiovese,Castello Romitorio,"This features aromas of oak, wood shop, vanilla and toast. The densely colored, dark palate offers prune, roasted coffee bean, anise and oak alongside assertive, extremely astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Portets,"Strongly aromatic, this wood-aged wine is perfumed with both toast and smokiness. The palate has fruit, but the acidity both from that fruit and the wood dominates, suggesting the wine needs to age. Drink from 2016."
US,87,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Villa San Juliette,"The nose on this wine from American Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick is a bit reluctant to show itself at first, then lets go of rounded red and purple fruits, with freshly turned soil and dust. Ripe black cherries and tart plum skins mix on the earthy palate, and the tannins will unfurl with more time."
US,87,22.0,Chardonnay,Hat Ranch,"This well-made, stainless-steel-fermented and aged Chardonnay offers notes of red apple and spice. It's straightforward and provides pleasant, easy drinking."
US,87,16.0,White Blend,Huston,"This Riesling, Muscat and Viognier blend marries the best of each and provides a lot of value. Aromas suggest apricot, white flowers, orange peel and freshly baked biscuits. It drinks full bodied and dry, but with sweet fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Italy,87,28.0,Vermentino,Fattoria di Magliano,"Here's a bright, crisp white that delivers aromas of apricot, nectarine, white peach and a whiff of Mediterranean brush that all carry over to the palate. Mineral notes add energy to the juicy fruit flavors, while zesty acidity generates a clean, refreshing finish."
Spain,87,25.0,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,"Initial aromas of aged cheese, gym shoes and overall funk are more complicated than easy. This is lacks a center point on the palate, while flavors of briny stone fruits are drawn, buttery and oxidized. A briny apricot note rises up on the finish."
Italy,87,17.0,Red Blend,Ceralti,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this wine features earthy aromas of leafy forest floor, tilled soil and dried black currant. The straightforward palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry and clove alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2016."
US,87,17.0,Riesling,Coiled,"All coming from Block 17 of Skyline Vineyard, this is aromatic with lime, mineral and stone fruit. It drinks just off dry (7g/L residual sugar), with a phenolic, almost creamy feel."
Spain,87,15.0,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza,"Wiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla. On the palate, there's a blend of creamy oak and sharp acidity, while flavors of plum and boysenberry are tart overall but again softened by barrel-driven vanilla notes. Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish."
Spain,87,16.0,Sherry,Delgado Zuleta,"Smooth, nutty aromas include vanilla and flor scents. This has a dry palate with flavors of orange, lemon, salt and peanuts. It's crisp but metallic in feel, with angular acidity and a finish that's salty in flavor and slightly oily in texture."
Spain,87,15.0,Tempranillo Blend,Señorío de Sotillo,"Crisp, minty, herbal aromas of berry and plum lead to a bright, rumbling, tannic palate with energy. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are good and earthy, while the finish is plump but braced by lively acidity. This is well made and satisfying for a basic roble wine."
US,87,38.0,Tempranillo,Vale,"The oak notes of dried coconut, coffee bean and vanilla are far out front here and provide a good deal of the aromas and flavors. But some pretty things are going on in the bottle; it's just hard to get at them."
Spain,87,28.0,Red Blend,Portal del Montsant,"Berry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm."
Italy,87,52.0,Sangiovese,La Collina dei Lecci,"This concentrated wine offers warm-climate aromas of stewed plum and scorched earth. The dense palate offers prune, baked black cherry, nutmeg and clove alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors."
Italy,87,58.0,Sangiovese,Fattoria La Lecciaia,"Aromas of cured meat, stewed fruit and toasted oak lead the nose. On the ripe palate, notes of powdered sage, vanilla and oak spices accent fleshy black plum. Bracing tannins provide the framework, but drink soon to capture the fruit richness."
Italy,87,60.0,Sangiovese,Ferrero,"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, plum, espresso and coconut. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive but offers dried black fruit, roasted coffee bean and clove alongside raspy tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the close."
Portugal,86,15.0,Rosé,Colinas do Douro,"Young Touriga Nacional vines produced this crisp, refreshing wine. With red currant flavor and a light touch of caramel, it's both fruity and full in the mouth. Drink now."
Italy,86,15.0,White Blend,Latium di Morini,"Made with no added sulfites, this has aromas suggesting resin and balsamic notes. The palate is almost overripe and rather evolved, offering dried apricot and crystallized ginger while a note of candied nectarine zest marks the close."
US,86,26.0,Chardonnay,Lawer,"From an estate vineyard, this wine is robust, full-bodied and viscous, with an underlying hint of petrol and plenty of oak. There's a tartness behind its flavors that gives it a lift as it finds its way to the finish."
US,86,32.0,Syrah,Hawk Watch Winery,"There's a touch of barnyard on the nose of this bottling, which also shows a soy and sweet black cherry scents. The palate is marked by beef char and cooked black fruit flavors, with a twist of funkiness, lending intrigue."
Portugal,86,10.0,Portuguese Red,Falua,"This wine is full of red berry flavor and soft tannins. With its forward fruit and smooth texture, it's made to be drunk young, so drink now."
Argentina,86,10.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Finca Las Moras,"Although this San Juan SB offers almost nothing on the nose, it's fresh and popping with acidity on the palate. Flavors of briny citrus are entirely familiar, while this finishes with cleansing crispness."
US,86,18.0,Moscato,The Naked Grape,"Rose petal aromas and lychee flavors make this a colorful and lively wine to sniff and sip. The powerful floral and fruity character rests in a soft, sweet texture that carries into a lingering finish."
Portugal,86,12.0,Portuguese White,Ramos-Pinto,"This wine is produced from two of the quintas owned by Ramos-Pinto. It's fruity and crisp, packed with bright fruit and lively acidity, and finishes on tangy citrus with a riper, creamy texture. Drink from late 2017."
US,86,35.0,Rosé,Obelisco Estate,"This wine is a pale cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. It brings off-dry elegantly styled cherry flavors that winnow toward the finish."
US,86,34.0,Aglianico,Orsi Family Vineyards,"Dried cranberry and currant flavors with raisin-plum cake undertones define this light-bodied wine that's mildly tannic, tart, simple and easy to like."
Argentina,86,23.0,Malbec,Bota Box,"This boxed Malbec is burgundy-colored and opens with spicy reedy aromas of dried herbs and red-berry fruits. On the palate, this is tight but shallow in the midtier. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits come with a note of cocoa powder prior to a stable finish."
South Africa,86,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Bouchard Finlayson,"Muted, soft scents of green apple, orange peel and underripe banana dance on the nose, while the zippy, prickly palate offers pithy flavors of citrus zest, ending slightly bitter. Drink now."
US,86,31.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Winc,"This 100% varietal wine is aged in American oak, offering an approachable, rounded, full-bodied impression of pencil shavings, cherry, leather and tobacco bound by firm tannins."
US,86,24.0,Viognier,Cass,"Concentrated orange blossom, bubblegum and a touch of minerality show on the nose of this bottling, suggesting sweetness. The palate is dry, if a tad syrupy, revealing warm climate flavors like poached apple, pear and lemon curd, tasting a bit like cough syrup."
US,86,12.0,Merlot,Castle Rock,"Aromas of green wood, herb and cherry lead to ripe but chalky feeling fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but a sense of astringency and bitterness proves distracting."
US,86,18.0,Pinot Noir,Angeline,"A substantial dose of fruit and good, grippy texture make this hearty wine ready for any protein dishes. It has full body, tasty black cherry and plum flavors and moderate tannins that lend structure."

Argentina,86,15.0,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón,"Jammy blueberry aromas come with overt oakiness. This feels dense but on the flat side. Baked berry flavors and herbal plum notes sprinkle in a mild sweet and green accent, while this feels full and a bit syrupy on the finish."
US,86,24.0,Chardonnay,Eberle,"This bottling is ripe and tropical but approachable on the nose, with honeydew melon, banana and nectarine aromas. There is a decent punch of acidity and noticeable texture upon first sip, veering toward sweet apple and bubblegum flavors on the finish."
Argentina,86,14.0,Torrontés,Finca la Malena,"A mild nose with little extravagance offers modest lemon aromas. The palate on this light-bodied white holds onto that lemony character via pithy, somewhat yeasty citrus flavors. The short non-effusive finish is tangy."
US,86,14.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Firestone,"Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture."

US,86,28.0,Barbera,Orsi Family Vineyards,"This dull, rustic wine offers earth and anise flavors around a core of soft cherry fruit. Light bodied, its acidity is moderate and unobtrusive."
Portugal,86,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Arrobe,"This wine comes from the northern reaches of Tejo, giving it a structured, cool and bright, fruity character. Juicy acidity cuts through its tannins and black plum flavor. Needing a few more months of bottle age, it will be ready to drink in 2018."
Portugal,86,30.0,Portuguese Rosé,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,"This is a fashionably pale rosé, as light and bright in color as it is on the palate. Fruity, attractive and ready to drink, it has zesty orange peel and crisp wild strawberry flavors."
US,89,49.0,Pinot Noir,Foursight,"Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins."

Italy,89,43.0,Sangiovese,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"This Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, underbrush, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of roasted coffee beans, all of which carry over to the concentrated palate along with black pepper and clove. The tannins are still tightly wound but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness."
France,89,19.0,Red Blend,Domaine Rotier,"This blend of local Duras and Braucol with the more Mediterranean Syrah is attractively spicy and juicy. It is packed with red fruits, sweet berry flavors and ripe tannins. The wine is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2016."

Germany,89,26.0,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,"Pressed apple and pears seem to be dusted in pollen and saffron on the nose of this savory, spicy Riesling. It's off dry and delicate in style, but concentrated in lip smacking tangerine and lime flavors. Dusty, earthy tones persist through the moderately long finish."
Italy,89,,Prié Blanc,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle,"This Alpine sparkler opens with aromas that recall honeysuckle, lily of the valley and candied citrus. The firm palate delivers ripe yellow apple, nectarine zest, candied ginger and toasted walnut accompanied by crisp acidity."

France,89,,Negrette,Château Bouissel,"La Guillotte is a parcel on the Bouissel estate, planted with old Négrette. This firm and structured wine is solid with black plum fruits and cherry acidity. It is still developing and will need some time to soften its tannins. Drink from 2017."
US,89,46.0,Pinot Noir,Anam Cara,"The estate reserve gets more new and once-filled oak, and is a selection from vines whose yield has been dropped to 1.5 tons/acre. It's forward and flavorful, with black cherry, coffee and anise components. The entry is smooth and continues so, on through a finish complete with sandalwood and butterscotch."

Stewed plums, cherries and strawberries dominate the tasty palate, with a proper acidity and woody bitterness as balance."
Portugal,89,45.0,Syrah,Quinta da Romaneira,A palate of exotic perfumes with layers of dark chocolate and dense tannins certainly give this wine great power. It is dark and brooding—almost too much in the intensity of its flavors and structure. It's going to remain a big beast as it ages. Drink from 2017.
US,89,39.0,Syrah,Rideau,"Boysenberry, dried violets and black pepper show on the nose of this wine from a popular vineyard in the Alisos Canyon area near Los Alamos.

Spain,89,23.0,Red Blend,Vega Escal,"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018."

US,89,65.0,Zinfandel,Epoch Estate Wines,"Dried strawberries, wild berries, cloves cinnamon and cocoa powder power the nose on this bottling from a vineyard named after a famous composer who once owned the property. There's not much fruit on the palate, just a touch of dried black cherries, but plenty of dried herbs, milk and dark chocolate and mocha-cappuccino flavors. It's a touch hot."
Chile,89,19.0,Red Blend,Estampa,"Blackberry, cassis, herb and spice aromas are complete and ripe. This Cabernet-led blend is focused and direct on the palate, with berry, cassis, chocolate and oaky flavors. A similar tasting finish, with additional chocolate and creamy oak is weighty and pleasing."
US,89,35.0,Syrah,Ledger David,"Pure Syrah, this is young, spicy and crisp, with blue plum, red licorice and a streak of dark chocolate. It has a light suggestion of the gamy, cured meat character that typifies Syrah. This marks a good start for such young (second leaf) vines."
US,89,60.0,Zinfandel,Lone Madrone,"Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly."
US,89,44.0,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox,"Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome."
Spain,89,25.0,Albariño,Mar de Frades,"Look for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albariño. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits.

Italy,89,30.0,Red Blend,Pratesi,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, toasted oak, espresso and licorice. The palate delivers blackberry extract, anise, clove and tobacco while dusty tannins provide support."
Spain,89,12.0,Tempranillo,Maitea,"Briary, dry, lightly oaked aromas of plum and berry lead to a bright, forward, juicy palate with fresh acidity and racy flavors of cherry and plum. This is short but clean on the finish, and overall it's the type of simple, drinkable, affordable Ribera del Duero that fans of the region don't come across often enough."
Spain,89,18.0,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig,"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up."
US,92,30.0,Chardonnay,Martin Ray,"This is an excellent Chardonnay for an accessible price. It's balanced and textured, with bites of apple and anise highlighting the journey. Power and finesse are offered in equal measure. A delicious wine for the table, it will impress with its depth and complexity."
France,92,,Riesling,Boeckel,"A parcel of old vines in the Brandluft vineyard gives the typical concentration and intense minerality to be expected from low yields. The wine is perfumed, with a bone-dry texture and melon and orange fruitiness. It needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Portugal,92,23.0,Portuguese Red,Castello d'Alba,"Rui Madeira's flagship red is a formidable, powerful wine. It has intense tannins that are surrounded by dark fruits and rich, juicy acidity. The core is dry, concentrated and dense, and the wood aging shows against the background of ripe fruits, promising good aging potential. Drink from 2018."
US,92,45.0,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"Spicy in black plum and berry fruit, Black Chicken is a consistent blockbuster for Biale, alive and fresh in waves of exotic cinnamon and clove.

The grapes are sourced from the winery's estate sites within the Oak Knoll District, where it's based."
US,92,125.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sequoia Grove,"Muted black plum teases from the nose of this wine, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot.

US,92,98.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,VinRoc,"From a single-vineyard, estate-grown and bottled, this is an intense 100% Cabernet, generous in roasted plum, cedar and coffee. With supple tannins it's easy to enjoy, concentrated and dark, a good match for roasted meats and savory pies."
US,92,40.0,Red Blend,Ferguson Crest,"Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie and Winemaker Joey Tensley converge on a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that's worth sitting on until at least 2019. Woody, cigar box aromas pick up notes of camphor and flashes of red fruit, and the flavors fall in line around the cedar, with blueberry, black cherry and milk chocolate."
Canada,92,17.0,Riesling,Cave Spring,"Coming from vines ranging in age from 9–39 years, this is an aromatically complex wine, with notes of wet slate, orange peel and herb. It drinks off dry, with tart, mouthwatering acidity accenting the abundant stone fruit flavors—a thriller of a wine."
US,92,60.0,Chardonnay,Sanguis,"Working from an urban winery on Santa Barbara's Eastside, Matthias Pippig created the Loner Chardonnay series. This entry begins with scents of cider, nectarine and lemon-lime soda before delving into a palate laden with yellow fruits and flowers. Sourdough yeastiness surrounds a lingering line of grapefruit zest-led acidity."
Portugal,92,70.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta da Romaneira,"A solid, firm wine with a great rapport between the black berry fruits, juicy acidity and dark tannins. It has a fresh element along with a powerful structure and dense mineral texture. It will age well, so drink from 2017."
US,92,68.0,Chardonnay,Ram's Gate,"With voluptuous confectionary-like aromas surrounded by a rich toasty character, this wine from the wonderful Hyde Vineyard offers lemon and crisp yellow apple around a core of brilliant minerality. Vanilla and crème brûlée interplay on the palate, the body of the wine firm and round."
Portugal,92,40.0,Baga,Luis Pato,"This is a rich, full-bodied and wood-aged wine, produced from vines in the village of Panasqueira. It has herbal and mint flavors, with black fruit tones powered by structured tannins. It is impressive, ripe, and still maturing. Best after 2016."
US,92,32.0,Chardonnay,Array,"Big points for subtlety, length and elegance here—this is not a wine that will blow you away at first sniff. Stay with it and it stays with you; opening sharp-edged, pungent and slightly grassy, then developing a tightly focused midpalate with pure lime and apple fruit flavors. Accents of mustard greens and white pepper come in as a long, delicate yet detailed finish slowly unfolds."
US,92,45.0,Syrah,Vie Winery,Scents of effervescent cherry and mint run with emergent licorice and slate on this wine that proves lithe yet flavorful on the palate. Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.
US,92,66.0,Chardonnay,Woodward Canyon,"This single-vineyard wine shows both the warmth of the vintage and the coolness of this site, boasting depth and richness to the fruit flavors while retaining good acidity. It combines notes of apple, peach and lees with light barrel accents—20% new French—and a creamy feel. Enjoy with shrimp stir fried in olive oil for a pairing nirvana."
France,92,29.0,Riesling,Domaine Loew,"This is rich and full-bodied, a splendid wine with its ripe yellow fruits, intensely aromatic character and a pinch of pepper. Concentrated, it finishes with a light touch of toastiness that hints at the maturity to come. Drink from 2016."
France,92,63.0,Riesling,Hugel,"Part of the impressive series of Jubilée wines that are aged before release, this Hugel Riesling is just getting to maturity with its soft aromatic character, touch of toastiness, and refreshing herbal flavors. It's now ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2016."
US,92,32.0,Chardonnay,Lafond,"This begins with scents of dried orange rinds and mango laced with honey as well as deeper aromas of rocks and savory herbs. A tight lemon acidity runs down the middle of the palate, with yellow flowers, yeast and toasted pine nuts on the side. It's both racy and rounded, and is showing a touch of age."
US,92,55.0,Chardonnay,Lynmar,"Honeysuckle and jasmine pique interest aromatically before luscious, linear waves of vanilla, caramel and lemon custard graciously interject, buoyed by ample acidity and a lush texture. This Chardonnay offers generous richness alongside high-toned minerality, and is a delicious go-to for buttery lobster dishes."

France,92,18.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Marsau,"This special selection, tight-cropped from 30 acres of 100% Merlot, is ripe and rich. This is a smoky and fruity wine, in barrel for 14 months. It has ripe black fruits and rich, dense structure. Spice and toast balance the fruit, giving an impressive sense of generosity. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,92,23.0,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Rocim,"From a small parcel of land on the slopes of the Serra de Aire hills, this firm textured, cool-climate wine shows structure and depth. The fruit weight is concentrated with plum and juicy black currant flavors, rotating around a dry core of tannins. Age this complex wine and drink after 2015."
France,92,,Riesling,Jean Becker,"The wine is pure minerality, tightly woven into a tense structure and fruits that are still very young. It's complex, allying fruit with a texture that is steely and only developing slowly. It will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2018."

This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is racy, tight and hard-driving, with bold berry, pepper, baking spice and chocolate flavors. A toasty, peppery finish is juicy, forward and long. Drink through 2020."
US,92,35.0,Viognier,Force Majeure,"Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release. The mix of concrete and neutral oak fermentation brings out some nice floral highlights and a light hint of toast. The length and flavor development through the long finish are exceptional."
US,92,44.0,Chardonnay,Fort Ross,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body."
US,90,24.0,Cabernet Franc,Easton,"This is a classic version of the varietal, matching complex herb and cherry aromas with fresh, frank fruit flavors that also show hints of mint, clove and anise. It is all about vibrancy and balance, not full body, and has a welcome, appetizing personality."
US,90,20.0,Zinfandel,Easton,"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture."
Germany,90,22.0,Riesling,Kirsten,"Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021."
France,90,50.0,Pinot Noir,Labouré-Roi,"Situated close to the northern edge of Beaune vineyards, this premier cru has something of the soft ripeness of Savigny-lès-Beaune next door. The wine is ripe, with tannins that are present although certainly not dominant. It has the potential to revel in its red fruits and generous texture. Drink this wine from 2019."
France,90,45.0,Pinot Noir,Labouré-Roi,"This structured wine still has wood aromas although on the palate the rich, dark fruits dominate. The tannins both from wood and from the fruit are firm and still young, showing the possibility of long-term aging. This complex wine should not be drunk before 2019."
US,90,23.0,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch,"Quite a steal of a deal for a widely available wine, this shows cinnamon, red cherry, ripe cranberry, light tobacco and a touch of leather on the rustic nose. Once sipped, the mouthfeel is soft, offering flavors of cranberry and red cherry that are spiced by thyme, bay leaf and more cinnamon."
US,90,49.0,Pinot Noir,MacPhail,"Hazelnut and truffle compete for affection in this juicy, rounded, lovable wine, a full-bodied and structured example from the appellation, known for its at-times generous portrait of tannin and wound-up concentration."
Germany,90,17.0,Riesling,Max Ferd. Richter,"Luscious white peach and apricot flavors are anchored by a steely core of mineral in this easy-drinking but elegant wine. Light bodied but persistent, it's a lip-smacking, sweet wine that finishes with a touch of brambly herbaceousness. Drink now through 2020."
US,90,35.0,Carignane,McCay Cellars,Aromas like wild berries and sage lead to moderate cherry and raspberry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. With each sip the fruit flavor seems to deepen and the finish seems to lengthen because of the wine's strong concentration and lively texture with just the right amount of tannin.
Italy,90,,White Blend,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth."
France,90,59.0,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019."
France,90,24.0,Sylvaner,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,"A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision. That stoniness lingers on the dry, gentle finish and the lasting flavor of fresh apple peel"
France,90,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Collotte,"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018."
France,90,20.0,White Blend,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,"Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses."
France,90,20.0,Pinot Blanc,Domaine Weinbach,White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.
US,90,18.0,Pinot Gris,Elizabeth Chambers,"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip."
Italy,90,,Nero d'Avola,Occhipinti,"Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this offers aromas of black-skinned fruit, tilled earth and cake spice. The concentrated but also focused palate shows ripe black cherry and crushed raspberry while nutmeg and carob add depth. Lithe tannins and lively acidity provide the framework."

Italy,90,22.0,Moscato,Planeta,"Here's a lively Moscato made in a dry style that opens with heady scents of jasmine, citrus blossom and yellow stone fruit aromas. The vibrant palate tastes of apricot, tangerine zest and a note of botanical herb alongside fresh acidity."
Greece,90,20.0,Assyrtiko,Santo Wines,"Crisp acidity and a gorgeous, aromatic nose lead on this elegant white. Though mineral-driven, it offers generous white peach and grapefruit flavors that will pair well with fuller-bodied fish. Impressive and versatile."
US,90,48.0,Pinot Noir,Soléna,"Among the well-differentiated single vineyard selections from Soléna in 2014, this may be the most instantly enjoyable. It's a big, mouth-coating wine, a full-flavored burst of chocolate-covered cherries. Lighter notes of coffee and tobacco filter in through the extended finish."
US,90,30.0,Chardonnay,Stags' Leap Winery,"The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak. Still, a richness of apple and pear compote provide a steady level of richness, while a lemon squeeze of acidity keeps it fresh and youthful."
Italy,90,,Frappato,Terre di Giurfo,"Aromas of iris, rose, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice lead nose. The juicy, easy-drinking palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry and black pepper alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Chill this down for the perfect summer red."
US,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boatique,"Seductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California. Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly."
Spain,90,20.0,Tempranillo,Bodegas Muriel,"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021."
Spain,90,17.0,Tempranillo Blend,Burgo Viejo,"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise."
US,90,22.0,Merlot,Chacewater,"This full-bodied wine combines deep, ripe fruit flavors, light spicy accents and a very firm mouthfeel that begs for a bite of a grilled rosemary lamb chop. The wine pushes the stereotype of wimpy Merlot out of the way and does it with fruit concentration rather than obvious oak. Drink through 2020."
Germany,90,31.0,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch),"Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett.

US,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hahn,"A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms."
US,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lyeth,"An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019."
US,94,62.0,Pinot Noir,The Calling,"Cherry pie and nuanced spice flavors buoy this delicately layered, medium-bodied vineyard designate that's built of robust fruit and supported quietly by oak. A thread of white pepper persists throughout, making it especially irresistible."
US,94,49.0,Pinot Noir,Trisaetum,"An aromatic textural wine, Wichmann sources fruit from the winery's oldest vines. Strawberry and cherry flavors are woven into details of citrus and tea. This elegant well-proportioned effort provides a feminine contrast to the sturdy Coast Range bottling."
France,94,25.0,Red Blend,Vignobles Brumont,"This is the home estate of Madiran superstar Alain Brumont. The wine is big, bold, rich and packed with both fruit and tannins. It has great structure and a dense dusty tannic character that promises great aging. This is a major wine that needs time. Drink it starting from 2022."
US,94,95.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frank Family,"This tremendous red wine is robustly aromatic, layering its black currant, dark cherry and chocolate scents with dusty sage and cedar. Luxuriously textured and smooth, it finishes focused and direct, with a lift of welcome acidity and complexity."
US,94,55.0,Chardonnay,Ancien,"From a cool part of the Napa Valley, this wine is bright and medium bodied—a moderately oaked mix of lemon custard, floral citrus and green apple flavors with an underlying spark of lemongrass and ginger. Richly layered, it remains balanced and structured as it opens in the glass."
US,94,48.0,Chardonnay,Barden,"Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now–2030."
Italy,94,35.0,Friulano,Borgo del Tiglio,"One of the finest whites of the vintage, this exquisite bottling has an enticing bouquet of almond, orchard fruit, almond and chopped herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers mouthwatering peach, apricot, almond and energizing mineral ntoes that carry over to the long, lingering finish, along with a hint of tangerine."
France,94,40.0,Tannat-Cabernet,Château de Gayon,"Eight years is about right for a Madiran to start its mature phase. This wine is just there, a ripe expression of Tannat. It still has tannins and they will remain, but the fruit has lost its raw youth and has become rich with dried fruits and acidity working well together. Drink this wine now and until 2025."
US,94,68.0,Pinot Noir,Demetria,"This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass."
US,94,90.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene,"Aromatically compelling, this offers a complex mix of clover, chocolate and cherry in the nose. It is a substantial, fruit-packed wine, with cherry and plum fruit, a full-bodied midpalate, mouthfilling texture and nicely integrated barrel spices. It finishes with a streak of Meyer lemon acidity. Drink now through 2030."
France,93,25.0,Malbec-Merlot,Château Lagrézette,"Produced from old Malbec vines in the second terrace above the River Lot, the wine is darkly concentrated, with solid tannins and generous black fruits. Aging for 12 months has smoothed the square corners to create a wine that is hugely rich and rounded. It has the potential to age and become more opulent. Drink from 2020."
US,93,60.0,Pinot Noir,Cherry Pie,"Cloudy, pungent and supremely earthy, this wine reveals its delicate acidity over time, bringing balance to its flamboyant fruit. With intense strawberry, orange peel and black tea flavors, it's savory and richly built, finishing on a touch of smoky vanilla."
Austria,93,21.0,St. Laurent,Johanneshof Reinisch,"Pepper and cinnamon strike first, before beautifully aromatic notions of blueberry, plum and tart black cherry appear. These scented fruits pervade the entire palate with spice, verve and freshness. A wonderfully poised Sankt Laurent at the perfect intersection of restrained freshness and glorious richness."
US,93,125.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,21 Grams,"High-toned aromas of cranberry, herb, black licorice and dried cherry are followed by tightly wound dark-fruit flavors backed by firm tannins.

Spain,93,64.0,Tempranillo,Lleiroso,"Deep dark berry aromas come with notes of vanilla, gritty spice and tobacco. Hard tannins require cushion and this has just enough to handle things.

Austria,93,19.0,Blauburgunder,Meinklang,"Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry. The palate brims with those appetizing flavors and adds an edge of licorice to the fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with a fine, taut, gossamer structure. A delicious Pinot Noir that's as elegant as it is refreshing and honest."
Austria,93,25.0,Blaufränkisch,Muhr-Van der Niepoort,"Upon first pour, this only shows some earthy hints of evolution. With air, the aromas awaken and lovely notes hayflower notes emerge. The palate is laced with elderberry and dried oak leaf flavors and framed by smooth tannins. Just a little bottle age has given this an almost timeless elegance, proving a wine doesn't need power to shine, just depth. Drink now–2025."
US,93,55.0,Syrah,Nicora,"This bottling reveals that this historic vineyard can produce incredibly rich wine as well as the zestier styles it is known for. It shows black cherry, candied strawberry and bourbon-like spice on the nose. The mouthfeel is lavish, full of purple fruit and floral flavors, as well as peppery spice and vanilla warmth. The acidity and structure are solid, and there's a touch of tar on the finish."
US,93,58.0,Chardonnay,Parallel,"Crisp with peach and apricot goodness, this full-bodied white's gravelly texture works to its advantage, providing both steely acidity and grip. That grit becomes velvety smooth as the wine opens in the glass, making it irresistibly seductive and inviting."
US,93,48.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish."
US,93,40.0,Zinfandel,Renwood,"Bright, firmly structured and full of classic berry and savory flavors, this wine is rich but balanced and ready to serve with a steak, chop or rack for a special occasion.

US,93,120.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia,"Another beauty from this producer and this appellation, Hughes is about granite-like minerality and rocky dust—a big-boned powerhouse from a powerful vintage that boasts generous spiced plum, cola, clove and black pepper flavors."
Austria,93,,Pinot Noir,Schwarz Wein,"Oak leaf, tart strawberry and supple vanilla aromas appear immediately on the nose and continue their smooth interplay on the mellow palate.

US,93,34.0,Zinfandel,Harney Lane,"This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit."
Spain,93,91.0,Red Blend,Pago de Carraovejas,"Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026."
France,93,36.0,Provence red blend,Domaine de la Bégude,"A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux.

It's a classic California Cab, rich in tannins, with brisk acidity and finely-etched black currant, cassis, mineral and oak flavors. Blended with some Merlot, it's fancy and elegant, a real beauty to drink now, and will hold in the bottle until 2024."
Portugal,91,19.0,Portuguese White,Wines & Winemakers,"With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine.

Italy,91,26.0,Pinot Grigio,Nals Margreid,"Intense aromas recall fragrant jasmine and honeysuckle alongside whiffs of exotic fruit. The round palate delivers juicy green apple, citrus and hints of yellow peach that end on a mineral note."
US,91,45.0,Pinot Noir,Beauregard,"Right out of the bottle, it's all about acidity and fresh, primary raspberry and cherry jam fruit. Wait until 2018 allow more complex mushroom flavors to emerge, as the wine gradually sheds tannins and develops secondary bottle notes."
Germany,91,36.0,Riesling,Domdechant Werner,"Whiffs of spice, honeycomb and lanolin meld curiously on the nose of this intensely mineral Riesling. Dry in style, with pretty yellow-cherry flavor, it builds in concentration and complexity as shades of spice, rock and fruit amass against a backdrop of sunny tangerine acidity. Drink now."
Germany,91,23.0,Riesling,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,"This dainty off-dry Riesling is marked by aromas—ripe stone fruit and florals against a backdrop of tea leaves and crushed minerals.

Germany,91,25.0,Riesling,Schloss Vollrads,"Lavish aromas of ripe peach, canteloupe and honeysuckle extend onto the palate of this juicy, fruit-forward Riesling. Semi-sweet in style, it's one lipsmacking nectar, with bracing lime acidity on the finish."
Germany,91,21.0,Scheurebe,Bürgermeister Willi Schweinhardt,"Zesty lime and evergreen notes mingle with luscious peach, plum and cherry aromas on this semisweet Scheurebe. The palate is juicy in stone fruit flavor, but refreshing and cool, with a bracing hit of acidity that lingers on the finish."
Germany,91,28.0,Riesling,C.H. Berres,"Smoke and jasmine-tea notes mingle seductively on this brisk, gorgeously floral off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush, with ripe peach and nectarine flavors that fill the mouth, finishing long."
Italy,91,41.0,White Blend,Franz Haas,"This smooth, richly textured wine offers concentrated sensations of exotic fruit, apricot, smoky mineral, golden apple, hazelnut and a hint of honey.

Portugal,91,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Rocim,"This wine is full of fruit, dusty tannins and great structure. A smooth surface covers the complex, juicy black fruits, dense tannins and mineral texture. This wine will certainly age, so don't drink before 2017."
US,91,28.0,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery,"This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find."
France,91,,Pinot Noir,L. Tramier & Fils,"Still young, it has dense tannins, spice from wood aging and a smoky bacon flavor that is still integrating. It will have the right weight and good berry fruits as it ages, giving a sense of presence and grandeur. Drink from 2018."
US,91,38.0,Chardonnay,La Follette,"This wine is as dry as Chardonnay gets, almost severe, with the alcohol an amazingly low 13.2% by volume. The lean, angular mouthfeel provides hints of Meyer lemons, limes and wet stones, with a bit of tropical fruits suggesting that this is California, despite the vintage being the chilliest in memory. Drink it through 2020, but never too cold."
US,91,44.0,Red Blend,Laird,"The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Cab Sauv brings rich black currants, as well as thick tannins. Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity. It may or may not age, but there's no reason not to decant it now and enjoy with grilled beefsteak."
US,91,45.0,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs,"Here's a big Pinot Noir, dark, dense and tannic. In part, those tannins are due to 30% whole-cluster fermentation, which also gives the wine a brooding earthiness and spiciness. Fully dry, it's packed with black cherry, rhubarb and pomegranate fruits. Hold it until 2018 and see how it's doing."
Germany,91,25.0,Riesling,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,"Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish."
Germany,91,38.0,Riesling,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,"Fresh, herbaceous notes on the nose and palate lend elegance to this rich, round Riesling, full of sweet canteloupe and peach flavors. It's delicately structured, with a zingy strike of citrus acidity and hints of spice that carry long on the finish."
Germany,91,22.0,Riesling,Dr. Loosen,"This semisweet Riesling balances an intensely fruit-forward profile of ripe yellow cherry and quince flavors against a backdrop of crisp, tart tangerine acidity. It's sunny and bright, yet elegantly composed, with a bristle of fresh herb notes that linger on the finish."
Germany,91,26.0,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,"Opening with aromatic notes of smoke against a backdrop of stone fruit and apple blossoms, this is a racy little Riesling that packs a powerful punch of flavor. Delicately sweet, with a saturated palate of yellow cherry and quince, it's smartly balanced by a sheen of minerals and brisk, bracing citrus acidity."
Germany,91,23.0,Riesling,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,"Wisps of smoke and candle wax seem savory in contrast to the ripe stone fruit and lemon aromas on this concentrated Riesling. Ripe, juicy tangerine flavors lend sweetness to the palate, but are cut with a vein of lime acidity that reverberates from start to finish. It's delicately textured, yet chock full of vibe and zest."
Germany,91,23.0,Riesling,Bollig-Lehnert,"While remarkably lithe and delicate in style, this complex auslese is lusciously concentrated, with ripe peach and nectarine flavors balanced by hints of smoke, spice and musk. It's zippy and bright, with tart tangerine acidity and a wave of minerality on the finish."
US,91,50.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Bernardus,"Very sweet, honeyed flavors mark this dessert wine. It has apricot, pear, lemon and vanilla richness, brightened by crisp acidity. It's absolutely delicious for drinking now."
Italy,91,21.0,Sauvignon,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,"The low-yielding vineyards generate concentrated aromas and flavors of cantaloupe, yellow peach, elderberry, crushed tomato vine and exotic fruit. A juicy palate is supported by fresh acidity and the lingering finish ends on a mineral note. It's crisp and delicious now but still can develop more depth. Drink through 2016."
France,91,25.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Devise d'Ardilley,"From a small estate, this big, ripe and fruity wine has swathes of black fruits to go with the dark, brooding tannins. Very broad and fruity, the wine is always likely to be structured. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,91,16.0,Portuguese Red,Dão Sul,"This complex, mature wine has plenty of red fruit flavors, but its main character displays concentrated, tannin and spice.

France,91,60.0,Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene,"White wines are rare in the Côte de Nuits and this wine is as structured as many reds. It does have strong toast flavors, a juicy citrus character and pear flavors. They go with an apple skin and spice aftertaste, laced with acidity. Drink until 2022."
US,90,38.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Louis M. Martini,"Rich blackberry and chocolate form around chalky tannins and a juicy palate, with a waft of cigar in the distance. Medium bodied, round and soft, the finish is brushed in cherry and pomegranate."
Australia,90,20.0,Pinot Noir,Riposte,"Tim Knappstein's decision to focus on the Adelaide Hills bears fruit in this terrific-value Pinot Noir. The aromas and flavors are a colorful mélange of beets, black cherries and purple heirloom tomatoes, backed by a rich texture and a long velvety finish. Drink now until 2020."
Italy,90,75.0,Nebbiolo,Virna Borgogno,"Stewed prune marinated in spirits, coconut, espresso and grilled herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers dark cherry, coffee, anise and tobacco alongside bracing tannins bright acidity. Best after 2019."
Portugal,90,33.0,Portuguese Red,Adega de Favaios,"A strongly wood aged wine, powered by tannins and dense fruits, it is concentrated and still young enough for the wood to show through although the fruit is developing well. This is a structured wine that will need plenty of time to age so drink from 2018."
Italy,90,75.0,Nebbiolo,Alessandro Rivetto,"This nose is rather closed but the firm palate offers ripe sour cherry, dark cooking spice, pipe tobacco and chopped herb. Fresh acidity and youthfully austere but refined tannins provide the backbone. Drink after 2019."
US,90,64.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ascension Cellars,"Vanilla, black-cherry soda and a berry crème brûlée character combine for a very playful and fun nose on this bottling. The palate tightens up that fun a bit but stays sexy, offering dark chocolate, red-berry jam and a shred of mint."
US,90,18.0,Gewürztraminer,Balletto,"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish."
Italy,90,75.0,Nebbiolo,Ca' Viola,"Classic Nebbiolo aromas of red berry, underbrush, tilled soil, aromatic herb and spice lead the nose. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, anisette, mocha, toast and grilled herb alongside extremely assertive tannins and brisk acidity. Drink 2019–2031."
Italy,90,30.0,Nebbiolo,Cantina del Nebbiolo,"Aromas of red berry, sage, cinnamon and a whisper of menthol lead the nose and carry over to the solid palate together with juicy sour cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's a classic Barolo, straightforward and delicious, with ripe, integrated tannins and fresh acidity."

The firm palate delivers dried Morello cherry, baking spice and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. It closes on a note of star anise. Drink 2016–2021 to capture the fruit richness."
Italy,90,18.0,Barbera,Cascina Liuzzi,"Firm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature plum, underbrush, baked earth, vanilla and exotic spice. The high-toned, chewy palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla, mocha, white pepper and mint alongside polished tannins."
Spain,90,20.0,Albariño,Castro Brey,"Classic Albariño aromas of sea brine, tropical fruits, lees and dust precede a minerally lemony palate with tangy flavors of lemon, lime and gooseberry. This is a fresh clean example with a long stony citrusy finish."
US,90,40.0,Pinot Noir,Chamisal Vineyards,"Nicely layered aromas of clove, graphite, iron and simmering black cherries show on the complex nose of this well-priced bottling. More iron and raspberry appear on the palate, where a balanced acidity pairs well with the strong mineral character."
France,90,25.0,Malbec,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,"This wine is all about juicy blackberry and delicious ripe black plums. It is structured, with dry tannins in the background, but up front is fruity, bold and with a lightly smoky, perfumed aftertaste. It is almost ready to drink; just wait until late 2016."
Portugal,90,19.0,Portuguese White,Conceito Vinhos,"Vineyards in the upper Douro Superior region are able to produce surprisingly fresh and fruity whites like this, despite the heat and dry climate. Old vines go into this yellow and green fruit flavored wine with its lively acidity and totally refreshing palate. Drink from summer 2016."
US,90,18.0,Gewürztraminer,David Hill,"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce."
US,90,30.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Davis Family,"This is a floral blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. The Roussanne speaks loudest, while the whole offers a mix of dried and fresh apricot and creamy vanilla wafer that's light bodied and fresh with acidity."
France,90,13.0,Red Blend,Domaine d'Arton,"This blend of Bordeaux grapes with Syrah is rich and spicy. It is made to be drunk young, with touches of toast and a dense texture that brings out the perfumed character of Syrah balanced with Bordeaux structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2016."
France,90,45.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Gérard Duplessis,"From vines on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, this wine offers notes of toast, spice and ripe yellow fruits cut by tense, zingy lemon zest. It is textured, tense and full of minerality. Drink from 2017."
Germany,90,30.0,Riesling,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,"Delicate whiffs of tangerine and lime intensify on the palate of this Spätlese Riesling, complemented by swathes of green herb and pine frond. It's superlight in texture, yet penetrating, showering the palate in sweet-tart grapefruit and Meyer lemon flavors. The finish is crisp and clean."
US,90,111.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eleven Eleven,"While soft and approachable, this wine also offers a density of black currant and cherry that gives significant power and juicy exuberance. Sizable tannins risk overtaking the fruit, but never do, with the oak imparting a jolt of smokiness on the finish."
Italy,90,35.0,Barbera,Elvio Cogno,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, scorched earth, exotic spice and a whiff of blue flower lead the way. The vibrant, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, plum, ground pepper and anise set in a framework of racy acidity and softly polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
US,90,32.0,Tempranillo,Folin Cellars,"In this ripe vintage Folin has produced a full-throttle Tempranillo: tannic, chewy and firm. Blue plum and black cherry anchor the palate, with notes of tobacco, toast and composted earth."
Italy,90,88.0,Nebbiolo,Franco M. Martinetti,"Dark and brooding, this opens with aromas of French oak, espresso, clove and mature blackberry. On the extracted palate, licorice, vanilla and sweet baking spice accent a core of baked plum while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework."
US,90,57.0,Pinot Noir,King Estate,"This appealing, youthful wine wraps bright raspberry fruit in a fragrant blanket of toasty oak. It's lively, detailed and impeccably fresh, with the balance to age gracefully through at least 2021."
US,90,34.0,Grenache,Kobler,"Big red fruit embraces chewy, integrated tannins in this vineyard-designate, a full-bodied explosion of ripeness and bold expression. While powerful, it holds on to nuance via streaks of high-toned citrus, allowing the wine room to breathe and remain lighthearted."

Drink 2017–2022."
Italy,90,74.0,Nebbiolo,Marziano Abbona,"Alluring aromas of violet, rose, dark berry and a hint of cured meat emerge on this firmly structured wine. The palate is rather extracted, offering rich black cherry, chocolate, tobacco and sweet spice alongside grippy tannins."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Matteo Correggia,"Waves of French oak, coconut, espresso and menthol lead the nose. The dense, extracted palate offers raspberry jam, vanilla, toasted oak and kirsch alongside packed, fine-grained tannins. The warmth of alcohol and a leathery note signal the finish. Nebbiolo purists may find the new wood sensations excessive but if you're into concentrated, oak-driven wines, you'll especially enjoy this."
Australia,88,42.0,Pinot Noir,Giant Steps,"This crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet."
France,88,27.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Gérard Fiou,"This lightweight, fruity wine is very direct in its acidity and canteloupe flavors. Citrus cuts the richness, while a fine chalky texture comes from the soil of the region. It's a wine to drink soon, fresh and packed with crisp fruits."
Argentina,88,25.0,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet,"Cherry and plum aromas are earthy, gritty and not overly potent. The palate is saturated, with the right amount of body weight and volume. There's a blitz of berry and black cherry flavors, backed by a finish that's black in nature and shows mild bitter notes of chocolate and coffee."
France,88,35.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Thomas & Fils,"Totally herbaceous, it's full of green herb flavors and tight with citrus and gooseberry. A light touch balances the intensity, giving freshness to the wine that's ready to drink now."
US,88,45.0,Meritage,Dry Creek Vineyard,"A red Meritage blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec, the name honors Dry Creek Vineyard's love of seafaring. With a nod to the Old World, it's lean and savory in black tea and exotic herb. Juicy, brambly berry come to the fore on the finish, which is still grippy on the palate."
US,88,30.0,Grenache,Epiphany,"A complex aromatic profile of the fruit, spice and savory elements found in plum chutney, this promising wine drops off a bit once sipped. But it is still tasty, with freshly picked plum flavors bringing fruit, tartness and tannins together, a bit of bacon fat on the finish."
France,88,26.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Etienne de Tauriac,"This wine has both fruitiness and delicious, bright acidity. A subtle use of wood creates a firm structure under the black currant fruit flavors, giving a solid base on which to develop. Drink from 2017."
US,88,39.0,Chardonnay,Fog Crest,"Fuller in style, it boasts layers of coconut cream pie, fig and honey, with a swirl of vanilla lurking in there too. Mineral-rich, the finish revisits the creamy, baked fruit theme, lush and generous."
France,88,25.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Francis Blanchet,"Crisp with apples and citrus, it's also laced with a more mineral character. It's full in the mouth, very bright with acidity and grapefruit. Drink now."
Italy,88,80.0,Nebbiolo,Germano Angelo,"This opens with aromas of plum, exotic spice and incense. The palate displays black cherry accented with white and black pepper, leather, licorice, espresso and balsamic notes but astringent tannins cut this short."
US,88,55.0,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye,"Big and flashy, it has oodles of almost sweet oak and ripe fruit character. Full-bodied, rich in texture, with ripe raspberry and red cherry flavors, it offers firm tannins and a lingering, vanilla scented finish."
US,88,22.0,Gewürztraminer,Gundlach Bundschu,"From old vines planted on the Mayacamas Mountains, this Gewurz is pungent in lychee and grapefruit, a trace of pepper, ginger and clove hiding beneath the surface. Medium-bodied and dry, it offers a rich interplay between herb and spice plus freshness on the finish."
France,88,28.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Jean-Max Roger,This fragrant wine is full of fresh citrus and green apple flavors that are crisp and lively. A steely element comes through to give structure.
US,88,25.0,Pinot Noir,Laetitia,"One of the many estate Pinot Noirs produced by the pioneering Arroyo Grande Valley winery, which was founded as a sparkling wine house, this offers scents of sandalwood, black licorice and red currant. The flavors are tart with cranberry, then bring some bitter notes of crushed herbs."
US,88,48.0,Pinot Noir,Le Cadeau,"Potent and pungent, it holds juicy acids tasting of grapefruit. It plunges into a chocolaty midpalate with strawberry fruit that thins into light flavors of soda pop."
US,88,19.0,Viognier,Lucas & Lewellen,"Light and brigh, it comes from tSanta Barbara County grape-growing pioneer Louis Lucas. Aromas of orange juice, passionfruit and sugared grapefruit peel create a strong introduction. On the floral-laced palate, pear cider and night jasmine flavors make for a solid sipper if not particularly complex."
Croatia,88,19.0,White Blend,Bibich,"This Croatian white is a blend of Debit, Pošip, Marastina, Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay. It has heady aromas of dried fruits, fresh peaches and buttered toast. There are great flavors of fresh stone fruits and black figs in the midpalate, and a pleasantly astringent finish."
Italy,88,77.0,Nebbiolo,Boroli,"This retro-styled wine displays its new-wood influence. It opens with aromas of coconut, oak extract, coffee and espresso that continue onto the palate along with a hint of mint and spice. But there's not enough fruit richness to support the evident oak and drying wood tannins."
US,88,18.0,Chardonnay,Chamisal Vineyards,"Light, bright and refreshing, it offers pear spritzer, lime zest and a hint of guava on the nose, followed by citrus rind, light papaya and apple juice on the palate. It makes a nice bridge between the richness of Chardonnay and crispness of Sauvignon Blanc."
France,88,25.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Cruzeau,"An aromatic wine, it has a rounded texture, a spicy character and only light acidity. Very forward and fruity, it's going to be ready to drink by 2015."

France,88,18.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Roc de Minvielle,"At this stage, the wine is closed, just hinting at its rich, fruity future. It has good acidity and a touch of bitter almonds, but the real fruitiness is still to come. Wait until 2015."
US,88,18.0,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt,"A collaboration between winemaker Nick Goldschmidt and his daughter Chelsea, this 100% Merlot delivers great value. Oaky in plummy black fruit and tobacco, it shows a touch of cedar and clove amidst mountainous tannins. An ideal wine for pepper steak off the grill."

US,88,65.0,Pinot Noir,Coeur de Terre,"The best of the winery's 2011 block reserves, this displays a solid core of cherry fruit, augmented with some streaks of steel and stone. It's firm and tannic, with plenty of tart acidity behind the crisp fruit."
US,88,25.0,Chardonnay,Cuvaison,"This longtime Carneros producer sources from dozens of its own blocks to put together this estate Chardonnay. Intense in floral aromas as well as peach and lemon, it's dusted only slightly in clove and a light barrel imprint. Bright on the tongue and on the finish, it's a food-friendly wine that will complement."
US,88,48.0,Pinot Noir,Cuvaison,"Silky in cherry and strawberry with a dense midpalate of refined oak, this delicately hued Pinot comes from a single, hillside block of Cuvaison's Carneros property. With pretty aromas of violet and rose, it has richness that isn't overdone, a nice expression of the appellation's power and finesse."
France,88,20.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine de l'Hermitage,"A cherry-fresh wine that's so full of fruit that its structure becomes secondary. A dry edge of tannin supports the fruit and acidity, making this wine so drinkable now."
Spain,88,11.0,Tempranillo,Venta Morales,"Plum and berry aromas are pure and compact. This is a lively, energetic, everyday Tempranillo with lots of bounce to its step. The power-packed palate is full of mixed berry flavors, while the finish is dense and comfortable, with residual weight."
US,90,55.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Korbin Kameron,"Smoke and oak pronounce themselves vigorously on the nose and entry of this 100% varietal wine, which holds on with a tight grip. Black fruit dominates with leather, chocolate and tobacco playing secondary roles. The finish is lengthy and powerful."
Spain,90,35.0,Sparkling Blend,Llopart,"In a small field of excellent Cavas, this bready, leesy, semi-rich bottling stands out for its totality and comfort on the palate. Along the road are aromas of burnt banana and toasted bread along with flavors of arugula, lime and dried apple. An elegant finish with stone-fruit and green-herb notes is sophisticated."

US,90,46.0,Chardonnay,Eric Kent,"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves."
US,90,55.0,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker,"From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028."
US,90,30.0,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker,"Cherry-rhubarb juice, shiitake mushrooms, sagebrush and iron make for a lush and layered nose on this appellation-blend wine that is widely available. The palate begins with plush red cherry then dives into oregano, sage and mace spice. It's expertly complex for a reasonably priced wine."
US,90,25.0,Cabernet Franc,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,"Ripe bramble and smoked nuts cast a savory edge to concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors in this robust wine. It's velvety and rich, but crisp, cranberry acidity and a granite edge lend elegance. Drink now through 2022."
US,90,27.0,Pinot Noir,Inspire Moore,"Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure."
US,90,28.0,Syrah,Kevin White,"Hailing from Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine brings black currant, huckleberry and dark plum aromas that smell pure and sweet. The black fruit and smoke flavors display a mixture of concentration and restraint."
Italy,90,62.0,Sangiovese,La Magia,"Scorched earth, toasted nut, espresso, cured meat and baked plum aromas lead the nose on this concentrated wine along with a hint of new leather. The big, chewy palate doles out mature black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2023."
US,90,48.0,Chardonnay,La Pitchoune,"This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish."
Italy,90,80.0,Sangiovese,Lazzeretti,"Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, porcini mushroom and dried plum aromas lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry confiture and licorice alongside assertive, tightly-packed tannins. Drink 2018–2024."
US,90,36.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Margerum,"A blend of fruit from the McGinley and Grassini vineyards, this wine is fermented in oak barrels, yielding a nose that's an approachable buffet of nectarine, wet cement, chopped lemongrass and wet hay. The oak also gives the palate more weight to deliver flavors of green-apple slices, kumquat, lime zest and cut lawn."
US,90,48.0,Red Blend,MCV,"Deep, dark blueberry fruit meets with beef char, fudge chocolate and espresso-bean notes on the nose of this blend of 59% Petite Sirah, 15% Syrah, 14% Tannat, 7% Petit Verdot, 4% Grenache and 1% Viognier. The rigid tannins need a little more time to open, but the zesty blueberry, blackberry and black-pepper flavors shine across the fresh, sizzling acidity."
US,90,60.0,Chardonnay,Merry Edwards,"Ripe fruit and oak loom large in this wine, produced from relatively old vines in the heart of the appellation, long a source for the producer's Pinot Noir. Preserved lemon, fleshy melon and caramel dance around each other, steeped in Golden Delicious apple, honey and pear. A high wire of acidity marks the finish."
Canada,90,24.0,Riesling,Mission Hill,"This comes in at 15g/L residual sugar, but it's more than offset with mineral-drenched acidity, so it drinks like a dry wine. Pale lemon in hue, it offers citrus flesh and rind in a young, yeasty, medium-bodied wine. The persistent, crisply-defined finish leaves a pleasing aftertaste of tangerine."
US,90,42.0,Cabernet Franc,Monticello Vineyards,"Plummy chocolate stars in this densely textured yet nicely lean wine, which finds balance and power in the glass. Cherry, blueberry and cedar make appearances, before a finish kissed in tobacco."
US,90,45.0,Sangiovese,Niner,"Boosted with 5% Barbera, this bottling for the estate's Bootjack Ranch shows ripe cranberry, red cherry, a pinch of herbs and touches of caramel and coffee syrup on the nose. A dense core of black plum skins at the palate's core is surrounded by bright cherry fruit, evolving into a dark chocolate and espresso touch."
US,90,39.0,Zinfandel,Ousterhout,"This vineyard-designated estate wine is restrained and elegant, allowing for a sparkle of raspberry and black cherry to speak. The oak is light and integrated, and the minerality well defined, with just the smallest traces of black licorice and pepper coming through on the finish."
US,90,25.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Ousterhout,"Tangy and intensely vibrant in citrus, this site-specific white sings in grapefruit pith and zest, layering those flavors atop spicy ginger and herb. It finishes bright and fresh on the palate, eager for food."
US,90,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Plumb Cellars,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half of this blend with the rest Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Vanilla and cocoa aromas are out in front of herb, black licorice and dark fruit. The dark-fruit and woodspice flavors are refined and show a sense of depth, elegance and balance that captures the attention."
Slovenia,90,40.0,Ribolla Gialla,Principiano Ferdinando,"Amber gold in the glass, this Ribolla Gialla has aromas of wet river rocks, vanilla bean and honeycomb. It has a luscious mouthfeel with pronounced minerality and flavors of apricot, apple and ripe pear."
US,90,40.0,Charbono,Sarah's Vineyard,"Not just an intriguing wine that geeks will love to find, this bottling of Charbono is intriguing and accessible to lovers of many different styles. Rich but fruity aromas of boysenberry, black plum, hoisin sauce and wood smoke give way to a palate laced with more plum and rounded purple fruit as well as touches of graphite and gravel."
Italy,90,60.0,Sangiovese,SassodiSole,"Sunbaked earth, mature black-skinned fruit, menthol, dark spice and a whiff of cured meat aromas emerge in the glass. The ripe, concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and tobacco alongside mature, densely packed tannins. Drink 2018–2025."

US,90,85.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,V. Sattui,"Mounds of decadent chocolate and cassis round out a smoothly textured wine dotted in dried herb and black olive, coming together in firm tannin and integrated acidity. The finish is leathery."
Spain,90,26.0,Palomino,González Byass,"This amontillado smells complete, with a tight aromatic mix of raw wood, brine, citrus and dried stone fruits. The palate is racy, with razor-like acidity. Intense flavors of dried apricot, tart nectarine and almond skins finish full  and lasting, with cutting acidity."
Italy,90,25.0,Red Blend,Il Brunone,"Aromas of scorched earth, game, truffle and mature plum come together in the glass. The ripe palate offers dried blackberry, mature cherry, anise and almond alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,90,15.0,Tempranillo,Matchbook,"Chocolaty aromas and ample spicy, dark-fruit flavors power this generous and firm-textured wine. Everything seems in place and in balance, ready to take on a nice roast or braise."
France,90,24.0,Rosé,Prieuré de Montézargues,"This is pretty pale for a Tavel, with a coppery tinge to its pink color. Notes of lime zest, wet stone and modest cherry-berry notes finish on a bright citrus note."
US,86,18.0,Red Blend,The Naked Grape,"This red blend is nicely dry, with abundant of dark plum and pomegranate flavors and a full-bodied, moderately tannic mouthfeel. It's easy to drink but bold enough to pair with hearty proteins."
South Africa,86,35.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Vergelegen,"This wine opens softly, with faint aromas of lemon-lime citrus and lean green fruit. The medium-weight palate offers a bit more concentration in green plum and lime tones, finishing pithy and somewhat bitter."
Argentina,86,26.0,Torrontés,Via Revolucionaria,"This uniquely tan-colored Torrontés is “orange” in style. Aromas of orange peel, peach, apricot and floor polish are challenging but complex. This immediately turns grabby and astringent on the palate, while stone-fruit and pithy flavors are short, quick and dry."
Argentina,86,39.0,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Las Cañitas,"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity. Disparate flavors of burnt coffee, tomato and stewed plum finish with scraping tannins and herbal notes that reflect the nose and palate."
South Africa,86,11.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Fat Barrel,"This opens with scents of green melon rind, strawberry hull and lime that carry through to the palate alongside an additional note of peach. A pleasant grassy tone gives interest to the finish, while ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and clean. Drink now."
US,85,15.0,Red Blend,Rubino Estates Winery,"While light in color, this wine is flavorful and easy to enjoy. Its smoothly textured, medium-bodied palate carries generous red cherry and plum flavors."
France,85,9.0,Rosé,Château Bélingard,This pale rosé blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is fruity with crisp strawberry fruits and acidity. It has a soft perfumed aftertaste that makes it immediately attractive. Drink now.
France,85,16.0,Red Blend,Château Clément Termes,This is the second label from this Gaillac estate. It is a fine mix of red fruits and spice—all fruitiness and with a strong shot of acidity. The wine is made to be drunk young; enjoy this summer.
US,85,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jack's House,A hint of maple syrup in the aromas and flavors gives this medium-bodied red a touch of sweetness. Oak flavors dominate the modest fruit on the palate.
France,85,18.0,Pinot Noir-Gamay,Joseph Drouhin,"A blend of 30% Pinot Noir and 70% Gamay, this is a fruity wine with the softest tannins and red cherry flavor. Made to drink young, it's somewhat spoiled by a banana-like edge that comes from its vinification."
Italy,85,9.0,Pinot Nero,Famiglia Cielo,This informal red has a shy nose that eventually reveals whiffs of black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of cooking spice. The simple palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside laid-back tannins. Drink soon.
Portugal,85,11.0,Portuguese Red,Fiuza,"This is a light wine with plenty of acidity and soft tannins that come together in a juicy, crisp, red fruit-flavored medley. Ready to drink."
France,85,12.0,Rosé,Georges Vigouroux,"A light orange pink color sets the scene for a fruity wine that has raspberry flavors, soft acidity and an attractive, crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
France,85,14.0,Malbec,Rigal,"Named after the series of vineyard terraces that rise steeply from the Lot river, this wine is soft and easily accessible. It does have the Malbec structure although this is comfortably balanced by the black fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2017."
South Africa,85,10.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Long Neck,"Fresh grass, gooseberry, lime leaf and a touch of melon rind appear on the nose and mouth of this straightforward wine. It's lightweight and easygoing, with brisk acidity and a crisp, refreshing finish. Drink now."
US,85,12.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mirassou,"This wine veers slightly sweet, like many overripe red blends. It's deep in color, soft in and makes a good counterpoint to spicy foods."
US,85,18.0,Merlot,The Naked Grape,"This is bold for a boxed wine, showing ripe, lightly spicy flavors supported by a firm and moderately tannic texture. It's nearly dry, too."
Argentina,85,14.0,Malbec,The Seeker,"Raspy berry and plum aromas lead to a palate dominated by tartaric acid. That, in turn, leads to sharp berry and plum flavors backed by a bracing finish."
Italy,85,10.0,Garganega,Cantina di Gambellara,This opens with aromas of resin and a whiff of dried flower that follow through to the lean palate along with hints of citrus and dried stone fruit. But it's cut short by extremely bitter sensations that recall walnut skin.
Argentina,85,13.0,White Blend,Chakana,"Basic white-fruit aromas are a bit dusty and yeasty. This feels plump, soft and creamy, with bitter-leaning green melon and papaya flavors. Notes of onion and grape skins rise up on the finish. This is a mix of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier."
Portugal,85,10.0,Portuguese Red,Boas Quintas,"This is an earthy blend of Touriga Nacional, Jaen and Trincadeira. Unencumbered by wood aromas, it's full of structured red berry fruit and balanced acidity and is ready to drink."
South Africa,85,20.0,Chardonnay,Bouchard Finlayson,"This is soft and accessible now, with plush notes of baked apple, creamed pear and oaky spice on the attack. The medium-weight palate is broad in feel, begging for a bit more lift to the rich fruit and buttered toast flavors. Drink now."
Argentina,85,30.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Zorzal,"Narrow berry aromas are angular and punchy. This feels high in acidity, with hard tannins. That sharp acidity makes for tart unyielding black plum flavors."
Spain,85,50.0,Red Blend,Vivanco,"An aromatic opening of compost and vinegar might suggest casting this aside. But flavors of strawberry and chocolate, along with an admitted weedy note, amount to something decent. Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins."
South Africa,85,16.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Graham Beck,"This is a fresh and lively white, with some green bean and herbaceous notes to support the core of gooseberry and lime rind aromas and flavors. It's light and straightforward, but clean and so easy to enjoy. Drink now."
France,85,11.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Les Vignobles Foncalieu,"Already a bit light in color and showing some rust at the rim, this medium-weight, silky-textured wine features aromas of sun-baked clay and cherries. There's not much depth or richness, but the tart fruit makes for an easy quaff. Drink now."
Argentina,85,15.0,Sparkling Blend,Cruzat,"This Pinot Noir-heavy sparkler opens with aromas of briny citrus and bready yeast. The palate is fresh and low on weight, with a dominating flavor of pink grapefruit. Overall, this is basic but easy to drink."
US,85,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spann Vineyards,"This is a simple, tart red, crisp in cranberry and red currant fruit and perfumed with spicy oak. Despite the high acidity on the front palate, it hangs heavy in full-bodied ripeness."
Bulgaria,85,9.0,Chardonnay,Vini,"This straw-colored Chardonnay has aromas of apple and citrus blossom with flavors of creamy apple, vanilla and citrus pith. It has nice weight on the palate with a clean acidic finish."
Israel,85,30.0,Chardonnay,Carmel,"A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes."
France,89,,Malbec,Château Bovila,"Seduction may be an odd word to use for a Malbec-based wine that is dark and drily tannic. It is structured and firm, with a dry core and black currant fruits. Drink this solid wine from 2017."
Spain,89,26.0,Red Blend,Bernard Magrez,"Concentrated aromas of blackened oak, blackberry, cassis, licorice and hickory smoke are clarion calls that this is a fully oaked, modern wine. In the mouth, it's heavy and tannic but doesn't trip over itself. Blackberry, cassis, burnt toast and campfire flavors finish equally toasted, peppery, charred and lemony, with chewy tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,89,20.0,Chardonnay,Hoopla,"With fresh green-apple aromas, and juicy apple and citrus flavors, this is a lively, crisp and well-balanced wine. Instead of going for overt oaky, buttery flavors and a fat mouthfeel, it stays nicely lean and refreshing, even with relatively full body."
US,89,25.0,Riesling,Kaena,"Coming from a vineyard near Solvang, this wine by Mikael Sigouin shows orange sponge cake, honey and the slightest twist of petrol on the nose. The palate boasts orange blossoms and bright acidity, gaining complexity from chalky white rocks and the slight bitterness of Japanese pear peels."
US,89,36.0,Chardonnay,La Fenêtre,"Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper. The palate shows woody spice and a unique iodine character, with cinnamon, salt, sour yeastiness and a touch of tart citrus peel."
France,89,14.0,Gros Manseng,Laudet,"A hint of honey gives this wine richness while keeping every bit of freshness. It has tangy acidity, a mineral character and apricot and mango fruit flavors. Drink now, although the wine will be better from early 2016."
US,89,36.0,Tempranillo,Longoria,"Rick Longoria's light winemaking touch even plays into this Spanish grape, which is daintier than regional counterparts. Red and Bing cherries mix with purple flowers, some dried fruit and vanilla paste on the nose. The palate leans herbal, with anise and chopped Italian herbs, also showing brick minerality and oak on the finish. The wine would definitely shine brighter with food."
Italy,89,23.0,Red Blend,Nittardi,"Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah come together to offer scents of red currant, toast, cedar and spice. It's firm and savory, with notes of white pepper, aniseed and dried aromatic herbs alongside assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
US,89,30.0,Petit Verdot,Opaque,"A black plum-extract character marks the nose of this wine from the folks behind Los Angeles' historic San Antonio Winery, but it's brown spice that dominates, particularly uncrushed cloves and anise seeds. Dried sour cherry and uncracked peppercorns show on the palate that is presented on rather chewy tannins."
Italy,89,28.0,Red Blend,OT,"Blueberry, chocolate, mint and clove aromas lead the nose of this blend of 50% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Franc and 15% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, coffee, cinnamon, black pepper and cocoa. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework."
Chile,89,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Primus,"Solid berry and cassis aromas are a touch baked on the nose. This is firm, moderately tannic on the palate, with baked plum, blackberry, vanilla and spice flavors. A woody note of maple gains prominence on the finish."
US,89,36.0,G-S-M,Prospect 772,"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm."
US,89,45.0,Pinot Noir,Provincial Vineyards,"One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up."
US,89,20.0,Pinot Gris,Raptor Ridge,"Fruity and almost off dry, this appealing wine goes heavy on flavors of spicy pear and apricot jam. A streak of honey runs through, and a hint of wintergreen. It's already drinking well, so dive in."
Chile,89,20.0,Pinot Noir,Ritual,"This fruity, friendly Pinot opens with ripe berry aromas mixed with touches of minerality and latex. It feels fresh and sturdy, with black cherry and raspberry flavors. A pure, sweet, lightly chocolaty finish wraps things up."
Italy,89,45.0,Red Blend,San Fabiano Calcinaia,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flowers, vineyard dust and dark cooking spices. The firm palate delivers black currants, licorice, cinnamon, ground pepper and Mediterranean herbs. Bracing tannins offer support and leave an astringent, drying finish."
Chile,89,20.0,Syrah,San Pedro,"Creamy oak, herbal blackberry, vanilla and mild green notes make for an intriguing, spicy nose. A heavy, tannic palate brings the weight and thickness, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry come with salty notes and a briny, herbal finish."
US,89,28.0,Pinot Noir,Soléna,"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already."
US,89,42.0,Syrah,Sunstone,"Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990. The acidity and alcohol combine for a tongue-tantalizing sip, with flavors of black cherries and dark herbs."
Italy,89,110.0,Cabernet Franc,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of green bell pepper, cedar and an herbaceous whiff of grass. The palate offers mature red currants, raspberries, exotic spice, toasted oak, herb and vanilla alongside bracing tannins. It has a tart, drying finish."
Chile,89,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viu Manent,"Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017."
US,89,14.0,Riesling,A to Z,"The Riesling remains the highlight of this value-oriented lineup, and it's now in a pretty floral package. Bright fruit flavors of orange, tangerine and apricot jam abound, with a clean and fresh mouthfeel. There's a hint of sweetness, but not enough to render it incompatible with most foods."
US,89,18.0,Rosé,Abacela,"This is 100% varietal, quite pretty in shades of pale pink, and perfectly dry without turning sour. Flavors of watermelon, pink grapefruit, rosewater and Jonathan apples all come into play. Drink it while the wine retains its youthful freshness."
US,89,39.0,Red Blend,Aver Family Vineyards,"Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins."
Italy,89,90.0,Red Blend,Castellare di Castellina,"Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up."
Portugal,89,18.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,89,7.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,89,17.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer. The wine inside is attractive and fruity, ripe with berry fruits and considerable freshness. The tannins give the power for the bottle, dry and dense at this young stage. Drink from 2017."
Chile,89,17.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Claro,"Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish."
France,89,20.0,White Blend,Clos Troteligotte,"This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV). From estate vineyards in the Cahors region, it is a young wine, still developing its potentially aromatic character, fragrant acidity and rich pineapple and red apple flavors. Hold this wine and drink from late 2016."
Italy,87,50.0,Sangiovese,Corte dei Venti,"This opens with aromas of toast, weedy underbrush and tobacco. The palate offers stewed plum marinated in spirits, anisette and coffee but not much fruit richness. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish."
Italy,87,87.0,Sangiovese,Tenuta Vitanza,"Pretty aromas of violet, rose and wild berry lead the nose. The bright but rather lean palate offers raw red berry, peppercorn and saline together with notes of dried sage. Astringent tannins create an abrupt finish."
US,87,28.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Mountain,"Aromas are dominated by oak with accents of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice along with cranberries, rose hips, herbs and raspberries. The palate is elegant with herb and cherry flavors that lead to a tart, cranberry-filled finish."
Italy,87,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Vitanza,"Warm and robust, this has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, grilled sage, leather and a balsamic note. The tightly wound palate offers dried berry, fig, menthol and licorice alongside super-astringent tannins and the heat of alcohol. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close."
US,87,36.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ott & Murphy,"Though just five years old, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot already seems quite tired, with notes of leather, dried red fruit and mushroom taking the lead. It has a pleasing, silky feel but the tart fruit flavors seem past their prime."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Gazin Rocquencourt,"Big, fresh and juicy, this is a bright and forward wine. Attractive smoky tannins are layered with fresh acidity and black currant flavors. The wine is already attractive, although there are enough tannins for it to age. Drink from 2017."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Haut Selve,"This wine is all fruit, crisp and with plenty of herbaceousness. A smoother character comes from the Sémillon in the blend that also gives richness. The wood aging shows only lightly, leaving fruitiness at the end."
France,87,35.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion,"Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Luchey-Halde,"The dryness and tannins of this wine are on the outside. Inside it has plenty of juicy fruit, sweet acidity and black plum flavors. Put the two together and this ripe wine offers plenty of potential. Drink from 2019."
France,87,30.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Peyfaures,"Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste."
US,87,28.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12,"Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is perfumed in lavender and awash in juicy red cassis. The acidity is medium to high, while the tannins are rough and chewy, suggesting the need for assimilation time."
Italy,87,20.0,Red Blend,I Greppi,"The nose isn't very expressive, but the palate offers mature blackberry, dried cherry, ground pepper, espresso and anise alonside assertive, astringent tannins. The dried fruit shows the heat of the vintage so best to drink soon."
US,87,18.0,Primitivo,Drytown,"Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine. The rich, ripe fruit shows right away in the nose, and continues on the palate but gets reined in a bit (in a good way) by a firm texture created by good acidity and tannins."
US,87,32.0,Red Blend,Entropy Cellars,"Extremely fruity and rich, this stops just short of sweetness while delivering delicious cherry, mixed berry and plum flavors with just a touch of tannin and acidity to keep it fresh. It is quite full bodied and ready to drink now."
US,87,28.0,Merlot,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of fresh-ground coffee, chocolate, herbs and plum along with barrel accents. It's soft in feel with an elegant styling, trailing toward the finish."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Taffard de Blaignan,"The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives a dark fruit character. At this young stage, the wood aging still dominates with its burnt toast and chocolate character. For the future, while the wine will be dry, it also has plenty of fresh fruit. Drink from 2018."
US,87,26.0,Syrah,College Cellars,This single-vineyard wine offers wild blueberry with vanilla and herb accents. It's full bodied and high-octane in feel with the flavors running straight down the fairway.
US,87,32.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Coquerel Family Wine Estates,"Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue."
US,87,11.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bogle,"Generous sweet-tasting oak flavor coats the fresh plum and red cherry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It has a broad, velvety texture, and shows good balance between ripeness, acidity and firm tannins. It finishes with a soft touch."
US,87,26.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Cairdeas,"This wine hails from Lawrence and Antoine Creek vineyards and was barrel-fermented in new French oak before being moved to stainless steel. It starts out quite reduced and then opens to show notes of peach, pear and mineral. It's rounded and lightly oily in feel, tapering on the back half."
US,87,19.0,Syrah,Cameron Hughes,"Tech sheets hint at Stagecoach Vineyard being involved somehow in this Syrah, a chewy expression of coconut, smoke and game around a dense, concentrated body and well-integrated tannins. The finish is all about mocha."
US,87,22.0,Red Blend,Fujishin,"Predominantly Syrah (80%) with Petite Sirah and Viognier, this wine conveys raspberries, cherries, flowers, black pepper and dark coffee. It's lighter in style with lip-smacking fruit and barrel flavors."
US,87,28.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hamilton,"Half Malbec with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine shows the oak up front, with dill and vanilla leading over plum and green herbs. The fruit flavors are plump and generous backed by vibrant acidity. Barrel notes linger on the finish."
US,87,28.0,Pinot Blanc,Las Positas,"Brighter and fresher than usual for this varietal, this shows green apple, lime, lemon and melon aromas and flavors. With a tangy, refreshing balance, medium body and crisp texture, it is fun and refreshing to drink."
US,87,20.0,Zinfandel,Maddalena,"This straightforward wine from the Riboli family portfolio goes down very easy, making it perfect for backyard barbecues. Cherries, dried rose petals and anise greet the nose. The palate isn't too complex, but delivers dark red fruits and pepper spices."
US,87,25.0,Red Blend,Markham,"There are a lot of varieties in this blend, from Merlot, which makes up the majority, to handfuls of Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot. Sizable tannins wrap themselves around flavors of tobacco, juicy plum and oaky vanilla, finishing dry and ripe."
US,87,16.0,Chardonnay,Rooster Hill,"While the nose is delicate with faint hints of yellow plum and pear, the palate is surprisingly brawny and bold. Rich, buttery and voluminous, this wine showcases ripe citrus and apple flavors, but falls a bit short on the finish."
US,87,18.0,Gewürztraminer,Rooster Hill,"While delicately framed for its variety, this Gewürztraminer is concentrated with sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Delicate hints of smoke, spice and blossom accent the midpalate and linger on the finish."
US,87,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pedroncelli,"This affordable, estate-vineyard 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is chewy in robust tar and leather, with companionable characteristics of cranberry and herb. The acidity is high-toned and the oak profile restrained."
France,87,10.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Producta Vignobles,"Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits. Acidity and the tannins promise some aging, although the wine is drinkable now."
Italy,90,22.0,Moscato,Planeta,"Here's a lively Moscato made in a dry style that opens with heady scents of jasmine, citrus blossom and yellow stone fruit aromas. The vibrant palate tastes of apricot, tangerine zest and a note of botanical herb alongside fresh acidity."
Greece,90,20.0,Assyrtiko,Santo Wines,"Crisp acidity and a gorgeous, aromatic nose lead on this elegant white. Though mineral-driven, it offers generous white peach and grapefruit flavors that will pair well with fuller-bodied fish. Impressive and versatile."
US,90,48.0,Pinot Noir,Soléna,"Among the well-differentiated single vineyard selections from Soléna in 2014, this may be the most instantly enjoyable. It's a big, mouth-coating wine, a full-flavored burst of chocolate-covered cherries. Lighter notes of coffee and tobacco filter in through the extended finish."
US,90,30.0,Chardonnay,Stags' Leap Winery,"The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak. Still, a richness of apple and pear compote provide a steady level of richness, while a lemon squeeze of acidity keeps it fresh and youthful."
Italy,90,,Frappato,Terre di Giurfo,"Aromas of iris, rose, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice lead nose. The juicy, easy-drinking palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry and black pepper alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Chill this down for the perfect summer red."
France,90,59.0,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019."
France,90,24.0,Sylvaner,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,"A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision. That stoniness lingers on the dry, gentle finish and the lasting flavor of fresh apple peel"
France,90,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Collotte,"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018."
France,90,20.0,White Blend,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,"Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses."
France,90,20.0,Pinot Blanc,Domaine Weinbach,White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.
Italy,90,,White Blend,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth."
US,90,18.0,Pinot Gris,Elizabeth Chambers,"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip."
US,90,70.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tetra,"This is a sanguine, full-bodied and nearly jammy wine, rich and plush in black and red fruit and a curious twist of beef jerky. Cedar and cranberry provide a crisper, more classical edge burnished on the palate in leathery black pepper."
US,90,25.0,Riesling,Trefethen,"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry."
Italy,90,36.0,Nerello Mascalese,Girolamo Russo,"Enticing scents of cherry blossom, Spanish broom, crushed rock and Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. The vibrant, tangy palate offers succulent nectarine, wild cherry, crushed strawberry and mineral alongside a backbone of lively acidity."
Australia,90,65.0,Shiraz,D'Arenberg,"The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018–2030."
US,90,42.0,Merlot,Herencia,Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.
US,90,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Levendi,"An earthy wine that offers complexity around a full-bodied juiciness of blackberry and bitter black tea, this is made in a big style and will appeal to fans of concentration and decisive use of oak."
US,90,28.0,Negroamaro,Monte Volpe,"Opulent blackberry aromas and a mouthful of jammy, grapey but dry fruit flavors put a lot of oomph into this focused, concentrated and well-balanced wine. It is just tart and tannic enough to pair easily with rich food, and those same qualities should help it mellow with age through 2020."
US,90,22.0,Mourvèdre,Morse,"This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish."
US,90,26.0,Barbera,Naggiar,"A winning combination of seductive, spicy aromas and generous, well-developed fruit flavors make this wine hard to resist. It is full-bodied, dry and quite full-flavored, but without overdoing anything, so it's well balanced."
US,90,80.0,Red Blend,Paraduxx,"Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl."
US,90,28.0,Tempranillo,Renwood,"Generous fruit and spice flavors and a full, chewy mouthfeel make this an appetizing wine to pair with big food. It smells like black cherries, tastes ripe and berry-like and has accents of cinnamon and cardamom. The texture is supportive and lightly astringent, with fine tannins."
Chile,90,24.0,Red Blend,Santa Ema,"Spicy, herbal plum and cassis aromas mix in notes of olive and wet dog fur. This is more spunky and fresh than dense. Leafy berry, plum and olive are the key flavors on this Carmenère-led blend that finishes herbal and spicy, with high-toned residual acidity."
Spain,90,21.0,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia,"Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020."

US,90,22.0,Syrah,Chacewater,"While relatively full-bodied and tannic, this wine also has friendly, fresh berry and cherry flavors that are held in place by very firm acidity and tannins.

Germany,90,30.0,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch),"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett.

US,92,35.0,Viognier,Force Majeure,"Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release. The mix of concrete and neutral oak fermentation brings out some nice floral highlights and a light hint of toast. The length and flavor development through the long finish are exceptional."
US,92,44.0,Chardonnay,Fort Ross,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body."

US,92,50.0,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"A brand new vineyard designation for the winery, Bedrock dates to the 1800s and is being made famous by proprietor Joel Peterson of Ravenswood and his son, Morgan Twain Peterson. This wine does the site justice, a smooth concoction of cherry pit and allspice, elegant and yet plenty generous in fruit and structure, measured by natural acidity."

Portugal,92,44.0,Portuguese Red,Poças,"Still dark and dense, this young wine has power and structure on its side. The tannins and concentrated firm texture promise aging, allowing the big black fruits to be released. Made from vines in the Douro Superior; drink from 2017."

US,92,35.0,Syrah,Comartin,"Jet-black aromatics of creosote, charred meats, pepper and plum-blackberry jam make an excellent entry point for this wine from a vineyard in the new Ballard Canyon appellation. Blackberry sauce leads the palate, with espresso bitterness and strong acidity throughout. A powerful but beautiful Syrah."

US,92,140.0,Merlot,Matteo,"Pure Merlot from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this finished its fermentation in concrete egg, then spent 20 months in 100% new French oak, and another two years in bottle prior to release.

US,92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Force Majeure,"This is the second vintage release for the estate vineyard, which occupies the highest planted portion of Red Mountain. Precise, sharp-edged, high-acid red-fruit flavors of berry and cherry seem stacked vertically, with a strong mineral underpinning. The alcohol is a bit high, but overall the structure holds together and would support further aging; drink now–2022."
US,92,40.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Foxen,"An aromatic profile of crushed mint, hot gravel and red fruit introduces this blend of 83% Grenache and 17% Mourvèdre.

Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins. There's life and snap to the finish, and though it's already delicious just two years after the vintage, another year or two of bottle age should see it continue to improve."
US,92,40.0,Chardonnay,Evening Land,"This is balanced and elegant in subtle pear, ginger and lemon. A fine food wine, it's ideal for roast chicken in herbes de Provence or ratatouille. Located in the Petaluma Gap and the source of grapes for several wines, Sun Chase was bought in 2013 by Guarachi Family Wines."
Italy,92,40.0,White Blend,Frank Cornelissen,"This cloudy, amber-colored wine isn't for the faint of heart. Made from ancient Grecanico, Carricante and Catarratto vines on the slopes of Mt.

The depth of flavor, drilling right down to the mineral structure, is impressive. Drink now, although also wait until 2016."
Argentina,93,40.0,Malbec,Viña Cobos,"The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023."
US,93,40.0,Syrah,Chamisal Vineyards,"The floral perfume of this cool-climate bottling is intense—all lavender accented with black pepper, white pepper and thyme. Tart black plum skin flavors lead the palate, building towards savory elements that recall dried purple flowers, thyme, rosemary and black pepper. Medium bodied and dense, it will be versatile with food."

France,93,65.0,Tannat-Cabernet,Producteurs Plaimont,"This is an impressively ripe and solidly fruity wine. Blending mainly Tannat with Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is certainly structured. But it is the brilliant black fruit that gives this wine its real character and density. It is impressive, and obviously made for the long haul. Drink from 2021."
US,93,,Syrah,Qupé,"Bob Lindquist shows his mastery of cool-climate fruit with this bottling, which is redolent of asphalt, cracked black pepper, rosemary, lavender and damson plum. It's fairly light in body but strong in tarry structure, offering loads of cracked peppercorn flavor with its juicy purple fruit."
US,93,28.0,Syrah,Sinor-LaVallee,"This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose.

It's light on its feet but has some textural firmness, finishing on rosemary, lavender and game notes."

France,93,50.0,Rosé,Château Gassier,"Aged in wood, this wine is rich and spicy. Its fruit though is beautifully in balance, ripe with raspberry and red-currant fruits that are shot through with lemon acidity.

France,93,34.0,Rosé,Château Grand Boise,"This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young.

France,93,50.0,Malbec,Château Lagrézette,"The estate wine from this Cahors showpiece property, it shows the rich intensity that can be conjured from Malbec, packed with tannins but also with dark, ripe-berry fruit and great intensity.

France,93,30.0,Rosé,Château les Valentines,"Named after the year 2008, when Provence's La Londe became its own appellation, the wine is an impressive selection from specific parcels in the dry coastal slip between Toulon and Saint-Tropez. It is textured, full of ripe fruit, red berries and a squeeze of lemon juice. The wine is full bodied, rich and likely to age for a few more months. Drink from early 2018."
France,93,40.0,Rosé,Château Roubine,"The top cuvée from Roubine, this unusual blend of Tibouren and Clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character. It is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus. This food friendly wine should age a bit, so drink from late 2017."
US,93,30.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Daou,"The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious."
US,93,45.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Darioush,"From the producer's estate vineyard on Mount Veeder, this 100% varietal vineyard designate is oaky, viscous and intensely flavored with green apple, melon and peach.

Structured to age, it will be best from 2023 through 2030."
US,93,60.0,Syrah,Hard Six Cellars,"The first vintage of this small-production wine, this is meaty, full of smoky pepper and dense red and blue fruit. It's powerfully built and structured, packing a finishing punch of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. A worthwhile new discovery and a producer to watch."
US,93,70.0,Pinot Noir,King Estate,"Domaine is the winery's top Pinot Noir: all-estate grown, from grapes now certified biodynamic. It's an accessible, pretty wine, with rich flavors of pastry fillings—think raspberry scones. It's got a tart, tangy grip and the length and structure to age at least a decade."
Spain,93,30.0,Sherry,Lustau,"Flawless on the nose, this amontillado purchased from the solera of Señor González Obregón is full of lift, power and toffee on the nose. There's zero excess weight to the palate, which features flavors of nuts, salt, caramel and dried apricot. On the finish, a hint of buttered toast offers an umami offset to acid-driven raciness."
US,93,60.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"Textural and beautifully detailed, this offers front-loaded flavors of cola, cocoa, graphite and tobacco, wrapped around blackberry and black-cherry fruits. Despite the relatively steep alcohol, this drinks in a lighter, more elegant, yet quite showy style."

It offers a rich core of almond paste flavor, with inviting peach, apple and pear fruit tones, all while remaining light, bright and highlighted with wet stone and gravel."
France,93,25.0,Tannat-Merlot,Vignobles Brumont,"The wine comes from a parcel of land planted with both Merlot and Tannat. In its structure, this great wine has a strong connection to the Madirans that are the hallmark of this producer. With maturity, the wine has developed fine secondary flavors and undergrowth and dried-fruit flavors. The wine, named after a standing stone found in the area, is very ready to drink."
US,93,32.0,Syrah,Waxwing,"From the cool plains of the Petaluma Gap, this wine shines in violet and blueberry crumble aromas. Light bodied, it reveals deeper, darker pepper steak-like flavors as it opens, finishing on an elegant aftertaste of clove."
Spain,93,61.0,Tempranillo,San Vicente,"This modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness. Aromas of black fruits, raisin, tire rubber and toasty French oak project a dark outlook.

US,93,60.0,Pinot Noir,Babcock,"Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush. The palate is rich and full bodied, with tangy red plum skin and eucalyptus touches, finishing on a fresh, menthol-like note."
US,93,45.0,Chardonnay,Babcock,"This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke.

US,93,60.0,Pinot Noir,Bergström,"Unusual aromatics conjure ruby red grapefruit, Douglas fir needles, green tea and a touch of cola. The site, which is rather cool, fills in the main palate with grapes offering sleek subtle flavors of mountain berry."
US,93,80.0,Pinot Noir,Blue Farm,"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait."
US,93,85.0,Pinot Noir,Challen,"This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip."
Italy,89,90.0,Red Blend,Castellare di Castellina,"Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up."
Portugal,89,18.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,89,7.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,89,17.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer. The wine inside is attractive and fruity, ripe with berry fruits and considerable freshness. The tannins give the power for the bottle, dry and dense at this young stage. Drink from 2017."
France,89,18.0,Duras,Domaine des Terrisses,"Made to celebrate their 30th vintage, the Cazottes have produced a ripe, full-bodied wine that is still smooth and rich. Raspberries and fresh acidity give fruitiness with a delicious juicy aftertaste. Drink this wine soon, from early 2016."
US,89,39.0,Red Blend,Aver Family Vineyards,"Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins."
Chile,89,17.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Claro,"Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish."
France,89,20.0,White Blend,Clos Troteligotte,"This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV). From estate vineyards in the Cahors region, it is a young wine, still developing its potentially aromatic character, fragrant acidity and rich pineapple and red apple flavors. Hold this wine and drink from late 2016."
Chile,89,22.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Concha y Toro,"A mix of tropical and citrus aromas is balanced by classic Leyda scents of bell pepper and jalapeño. This is crystal clear and zesty on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Lemon, tangerine and briny notes create a citrusy flavor profile, while the finish is juicy, crisp and cleansing."
US,89,25.0,Chardonnay,Conn Creek,"Minerally on the start, this white progresses into oaky vanilla and brioche notes with a heightened viscosity midway through, before re-finding its vibrancy at the end. In between expect a full-bodied, fruity expression of the variety highlighted by plenty of ripe apple and apricot."
Spain,89,50.0,Garnacha,Parés Baltà,"Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020."
US,89,31.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Fenestra,"This medium-bodied wine is fresh and fruity, but also polished and sophisticated. It smells like raspberries and black plums, then adds chocolate and blackberry in the flavors. Rich and flavorful it also has welcome firm tannins and fruit acidity to keep it lively. Grenache is the leading grape ingredient."
Germany,89,25.0,Pinot Gris,Franz Keller,"Wildflower and lemon zest brighten this dry, citrusy Pinot Gris. Lip smacking white grapefruit flavors flood the palate, along with a hint of bitter almond. It's a revitalizing white that's ready to drink, but also likely to maintain its fresh, primary flavors through 2017."
Chile,89,26.0,Red Blend,Maray,"This blend is mostly Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon backing it up. Dense, earthy, meaty and lightly roasted on the nose, the palate is mildly tannic, with lively acidity. Roasted, foresty plum and red-berry flavors end short and baked in character."
Italy,89,27.0,Red Blend,Nino Negri,"Vibrant and elegant, this delivers aromas and flavors of crushed red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon-spice and Alpine herbs. Supple tannins and bright acidity provide support. Enjoy through 2018."
US,89,25.0,Sparkling Blend,Laetitia,"Quite foamy when poured, this bubbly from the historic sparkling house offers aromas of apple flesh, ripe pears and lemon-lime soda. It presents straightforward flavors on the palate accented with apple blossoms, while white tuberose florals and a touch of guava trend toward the tropical side of the scale."
Italy,89,22.0,Red Blend,Leopoldo I di Toscana,"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice, underbrush and dried herbs emerge from this blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The palate delivers dried black cherries, plum, clove and grilled sage alongside tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
US,89,18.0,Pinot Gris,Lumos,"Spicy and still tight, this shows a big-boned style. Penetrating pear fruit flavors are dotted with white pepper, and finished with a hint of water cracker."
Chile,89,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maquis,"Dense aromas of earth, berry fruits, latex and animal fur are a touch challenging at first but balance out with airing. This has a crisp, fresh feel despite coming from a hot year. Lightly herbal, leathery flavors of red currant and wild berry finish oaky, with more than adequate filling."
Italy,89,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Petra,"Subdued aromas of espresso, tobacco, cedar, tilled soil and mature black fruit waft out of the glass. Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, the elegant palate offers raw red currants, dried black cherries, clove and anise alongside silky but rather fleeting tannins."
Portugal,89,60.0,Tinta Francisca,Quinta das Carvalhas,"Old vines of Tinta Francisca have produced a generous, full and concentrated wine. It is packed with forward berry fruits and as well as soft tannins that are finely integrated. The end is fresh, and always fruity."
Italy,89,52.0,Red Blend,Rocca delle Macìe,"Made from Sangiovese blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, exotic spice and a whiff of black currant. The palate displays toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, menthol, ground black pepper and dried black cherries alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,89,25.0,Rosé,Stoller,"Fresh strawberry fruit with a bit of spice makes this an easy choice for warm-weather sipping. Tart, with lemony acidity, it's young and lively. Good as it is on its own, it would make an awesome punch."
US,89,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tamber Bey,"Offered in a half-bottle size, this estate Cab-based wine also contains 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. The blend is crisp, dry and tannic in cranberry, barely ripe cherry and dried currant, swerving savory into dried herb and clove."
Italy,89,240.0,Red Blend,Tenuta di Trinoro,"Dense and concentrated, this blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot initially has a subdued nose that eventually reveals prune, alcohol, tobacco and leather aromas. The syrupy palate doles out blackberry extract, fig, sweet spice and soaring alcohol alongside velvety tannins. While some may like the sheer power, the dominant alcohol stunts any complexity, giving it a monolithic quality."
Italy,89,35.0,Red Blend,Tenuta Sette Ponti,"Firm and spicy, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of black plum, crushed violet and kitchen spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice and clove alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2020."
US,89,40.0,Pinot Noir,Walnut City WineWorks,"The vineyard is in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, though the label does not indicate it. There is a welcome purity to the fruit expression, pretty cherry flavors with a suggestion of hard candy. Although it has light herb and stem highlights, nothing overshadows the lovely fruit."
Portugal,89,18.0,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, this dark-colored, serious wine is concentrated and structured. It offers black fruits, giving a brooding character that's full of power. The aftertaste with its acidity and juicy fruit is elevated and leaves with a lift."
US,89,26.0,Pinot Noir,YNOT,"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious"
Greece,89,13.0,White Blend,Zacharias,"This exotic white blend starts with citrus and floral aromas and offers a palate of soft lemon curd, orange and white fruit. Rich but with a cutting finish, it's a good food wine for bigger seafood flavors."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Negro Angelo e Figli,"Mature berry, underbrush, leather, fennel and a whiff of grilled herb meld together in the glass. The firm, vibrant palate shows ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, coffee and a balsamic note while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Give this a few years to come together. Drink after 2020."
US,90,28.0,Tempranillo,Obsidian,"Smooth and appealing, with a smoky edge to the purple plum and berry fruits, this is a flavorful, forward and easy-drinking rendition of what may become Southern Oregon's signature grape. The tannins are silky and the length impressive."
Portugal,90,18.0,Portuguese Red,Poças,"From grapes grown in the Douro Superior region, this is an open delicious fruity and ripe wine that is ready to drink. Its black currant and red berry tastes are balanced by spice, wood aged flavors and a core of tannins. The aftertaste introduces fresh juicy acidity."
US,90,40.0,Red Blend,Ray's Station Vineyards,"Ripe fruit flavors and a delicious spiciness combine to make this full-bodied but not very tannic wine easy to love. It smells like cherries and raspberries, tastes full but not sweet, and has a texture that spreads and softens on the palate like melting chocolate. It's made with 50% Zinfandel and almost equal parts Syrah, Carignane and Petite Sirah."
Spain,90,35.0,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega,"Resiny oak and mildly stalky berry aromas muscle out cherry and raspberry scents. This feels grabby and clampy, while oaky flavors of mixed berries and baked plum end with coconut-infused oak flavors and notes of raisin and licorice. Drink through 2020."
Italy,90,38.0,Barbera,Rivetto,"Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, blue flower and Oriental spice float out of the glass. The round, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside chewy tannins."
Israel,90,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Segal's,"This wine is dark red-violet color to the eye, offering aromas of blackberry, roasted red pepper and juniper berry. It is very smooth on the palate, with flavors of black plum, blackberry, white peach, elderberry and violet. There is a slightly dominant eucalyptus flavor that backs off at the finish, replaced by a fresh cherry juice flavor."
US,90,72.0,Pinot Noir,Small Vines,"Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish."
Germany,90,60.0,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof,Fresh apple and pear flavors are swathed in fresh herbs and citrus peels in this bristling medium-sweet wine. It's lusciously honeyed but finishes long with honed steely precision.
US,90,44.0,Pinot Noir,Stemmler,"Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the “regular” Anderson Valley Pinot Noir."
Israel,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tabor,"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of strawberry, black plum, caramel and smoked meat. It offers a good balance of acidity and tannins, with flavors of blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, vanilla and mocha. The vanilla flavor is extended on the palate thanks to lingering silky tannins that eventually dissolve in a note of orange zest."
Italy,90,70.0,Nebbiolo,Tenuta Duecorti,"Blue flower, mature plum, licorice, clove, mocha and menthol aromas all come together on this brawny red. The warm, bold palate delivers juicy black cherry, espresso, ground pepper and anisette alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it won't need years to come around. Drink 2018–2028."
Portugal,90,30.0,Portuguese White,Terras de Alter,"This concentrated wine was wood aged for six months, giving the lightest touch of oak along with ripe yellow fruits and a crisp tangy aftertaste. It has a touch of spice along with bright acidity at the end. Drink now."
US,90,36.0,Chardonnay,Thomas George,"A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple."
Israel,90,40.0,Red Blend,Tulip Winery,"This wine features a bouquet of cherry, pomegranate and freshly ground black pepper. It is well-balanced on the palate with flavors of pomegranate, strawberry, mace and anise. Smooth tannins are present into the bright yet lasting finish."
US,90,70.0,Chardonnay,Wedell Cellars,"The nose on this appellation blend is full of soft tones of ripe nectarine and pluot, though cut with walnut oil and a citrus edge. It's more pithy in flavor, showing orange bitters, dried apples and more nut oils, slightly oxidative in style."
US,90,48.0,Pinot Noir,Winderlea,"Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rock—not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well. Drink this now through the mid-2020s."
Israel,90,55.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yatir,"Dark black cherry in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cherry preserves, matchstick and petrol. It is far livelier on the palate than on the nose, featuring flavors of cherry, pomegranate and bell pepper with a light touch of florality. Chewy tannins make their way across the gum and tongues and are all but erased by a final note of orange zest and cranberry."
Italy,90,42.0,Nebbiolo,Cascina Luisin,"Dark berry, mocha, toast and cooking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The taut palate offers mature black cherry, coffee and dried herb alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins."
US,90,125.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Azari,"Cherry-berry and vanilla surround a soft, spicy core of high-toned red fruit. Mellowed with age, the tannins linger in perceived sweetness."
Italy,90,110.0,Nebbiolo,Borgogno Giacomo e Figli,"Red rose, bright berry and anisette aromas lead the way. The taut palate offers sour cherry, tobacco, clove and chopped herb alongside bracing tannins and brisk acidity."
Italy,90,103.0,Nebbiolo,Ca'Romè,"This brawny, forward wine opens with aromas that recall spirits, steeped plum, roasted coffee bean and menthol. The dense, chewy palate offers black cherry liqueur, licorice, espresso and the warmth of evident alcohol accompanied by brooding tannins. Drink sooner rather than later."
Italy,90,100.0,Nebbiolo,Ceretto,"Aromas of rose, red berry, espresso, grilled herb and toast lead the nose. The taut palate offers crunchy red cherry, raspberry, star anise and white pepper alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean."
Italy,90,40.0,Nebbiolo,Luigi Pira,"Earthy aromas of leather, game, sunbaked earth and mature dark-skinned berry take center stage. The tense palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, espresso licorice and tobacco alongside fresh acidity and close-grained tannins."
Italy,90,68.0,Nebbiolo,Reverdito,"Mature dark berry, crushed blue flower, spice and peppermint aromas lead the nose on this structured red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, white pepper, cocoa, star anise and a balsamic note accompanied by bracing tannins. Drink 2018–2016."
Spain,90,24.0,Tempranillo,Valdubón,"Cherry and plum aromas are accented by buttery oak, leather and animal notes. Solid in feel with firm tannins, this warm-vintage Tempranillo is ripe, loamy and loaded with berry and cassis flavors. A lightly raisiny finish is friendly and round. Drink through 2019."
Italy,90,52.0,Nebbiolo,Vietti,"Aromas of wild berry, dark spice, menthol and a hint of pressed flower lead the way on this straightforward Barolo. The full-bodied palate offers dark cherry, licorice and dried herb alongside firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2026."
Australia,90,65.0,Pinot Noir,Dalrymple,"This is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2018 to 2025."
US,90,37.0,Pinot Noir,Antiquum Farm,"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new."
US,90,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Argyle,"Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity."
Italy,85,,Garganega,Marcello Turra,Aromas of mature yellow apple and a whiff of chamomile flower lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the extremely ripe palate along with a hint of acacia and a marked note of bitter almond.
US,85,13.0,Chardonnay,Auspicion,"Smoky, toasted oak aromas lead to strong char and butter flavors and a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Subtlety is not one of this wine's virtues, as its outsized flavors stand in stark relief."
Israel,85,30.0,Chardonnay,Carmel,"A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes."
Portugal,85,10.0,Portuguese White,Caves Campelo,"With its typical prickle on the tongue, this is a medium sweet wine. It's clean, crisp and citrusy, with sliced apple and orange zest flavors. Drink now."
Portugal,85,9.0,Portuguese White,Caves Campelo,"Lightly spritzy, this tastes of crisp apple and finishes just off-dry. It's deliciously refreshing, bright and tangy. Drink now."
Portugal,85,7.0,Alicante Bouschet,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo,"This is a dry sparkling wine with tannins, spice and berry fruit, giving it a deep color. Not an apéritif wine, it's perfect for cutting through rich, oily foods. Drink now."
Portugal,85,12.0,Portuguese Sparkling,Adega de Cantanhede,"This is a soft, creamy wine with fruitiness and a yeasty edge. Made from Bical, Arinto and Maria Gomes, it's ready to drink."
France,85,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine de l'Herré,"This is a soft wine whose herbal character is held in check by a smooth texture. It is bright and crisp, with plenty of citrus and gooseberry flavors as well as intense acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
France,85,9.0,White Blend,Domaine du Touja,This white wine is fruity and crisp with a deliciously refreshing herbal edge. Lemon and pink grapefruit are cut by some zingy acidity and finished with a bright aftertaste. Drink now.
Argentina,85,11.0,Malbec,Proemio,"Dusty plum and berry aromas are clean. In the mouth, this is hard and wiry. Salty snappy plum flavors dry out and taste a bit like tin on a raw finish."

South Africa,85,22.0,Chardonnay,Vergelegen,"Surprisingly shy and reserved in nature, this offers subtle aromas and flavors of apple core and spiced orange peel. Soft and accessible, it's direct and clean, yet short on the finish. Drink now."
Argentina,85,12.0,Malbec,Bodega Renacer,"A mix of blueberry, plum and animal aromas leads to a wiry, clipped palate fueled by tartaric acid. Lightly salted plum flavors are slightly jammy, while a blueberry note is brought back on the finish."
South Africa,85,10.0,Chenin Blanc,Essay,"Bright aromas of tart apple, melon rind and fresh chrysanthemum dance in the bouquet, while the lively, lightweight palate offers notes of white peach and citrus pith. A subtle astringency graces the close. Drink now."

South Africa,85,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Noble Hill,"Soft hints of peach, verbena and peony grace the delicate nose of this lightweight white. Touches of green banana and pear flesh out the palate, while ample acidity keeps the mouthfeel fresh through the finish. Drink now."
France,85,16.0,Rosé,Château Clément Termes,This wine's blend symbolizes the Tarn's halfway position between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. So it is has the perfumed Syrah and the more structured local Braucol to give a bright fruity wine with some touches of tannin as well as red-berry fruits. Drink now.
France,85,12.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Domaine de Grange Neuve,A dry wine with a soft texture that suggests a small amount of residual sugar. It is a fruity wine with apricot and ripe pear flavors and a smooth aftertaste that still leaves plenty of room for acidity. Drink now.
France,85,15.0,Chardonnay,Domaine de l'Herré,"Produced in the west of Gascony, with a strong oceanic influence, this Chardonnay is cool, fruity and with bright acidity. It does have a creamy texture that fills out the fruitiness. It is an attractive, ripe wine that is ready to drink."

US,85,30.0,Chardonnay,Thomas George,"From four estate vineyards, this wine appears to be low in oak and extra crisp in mouthfeel, offering austere apple and citrus elements with a slight metallic edge."
Italy,85,,Garganega,Tinazzi,This informal white opens with whiffs of orchard fruit and citrus while the simple palate offers suggestions of pear and pineapple. A hint of bitter almond marks the rather lean abrupt finish.
Germany,91,17.0,Riesling,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider,"Pretty floral and apricot aromas brighten savory apple notes on this dry, but intensely honeyed Riesling. Bright and brisk on the palate, with searing lime acidity, it finishes long, with a refreshing spray of green herbs."
US,91,65.0,Pinot Noir,Anam Cara,"The Mark VI (similar to the above Heather's Vineyard) is a sort of reserve reserve, this one from barrels chosen to showcase the most cellar-worthy aspects of the vintage. It succeeds nicely, delivering a solid, firm, tart wine with young raspberry and cherry fruit at its center. The tannins have a lightly herbal, leafy streak, and there's little doubt this will benefit from additional years in the cellar."
Italy,91,,White Blend,Vie di Romans,"This intriguing blend combines the structure of Chardonnay with the crushed tomato vine and cantaloupe aromatics of Sauvignon. The rich palate delivers a lovely depth of ripe apple, creamy lemon, and melon flavors, layered with hints of exotic fruit and spice."
US,91,32.0,Pinot Noir,Thistle,"A lovely, fresh, fruit-forward Pinot, it's flush with flavors of plums and cherries as it fills the palate. It gains power and mass with dark, slightly charred flavors of espresso wrapped into the finishing tannins."
France,91,24.0,Gamay,Trenel Fils,"This solidly structured wine shows the firm tannins and mineral structure typical of wines from Côte du Py. It has dense black cherry fruits along with sacidity that cuts through the structure. It could age another year, but is worth drinking now."
Portugal,91,35.0,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"This rich wine has a dense core of dark, dry tannins. The fruit, still taking its time to come through, is full of dark plum flavors and will soon show a fresher acidity. Wood aging, dark chocolate and a smoky character all bode well for the future. Drink from 2016."
Portugal,91,17.0,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"This rich, sophisticated wood-aged wine has complex fruits, structure and tannins. Ripe, juicy black fruits are intertwined with a solidly dry texture, powerful but still elegant. It will repay aging. Drink from 2016."
Portugal,91,22.0,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"A rich wine that is made by the Abreu Callado charity foundation. It has dark black currant fruits, big tannins and an elegant feel. With its structure, minerality and ripe, juicy fruitiness, it is finely structured and ageworthy. Drink from 2017."
US,91,36.0,Pinot Noir,McIntyre Vineyards,"You can criticize this as being too full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. Some will find it Grenache-like, with its lush, jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and oak. But what can't be denied is how delicious it is. The fruitiness, acidity and tannins suggest pairing with charbroiled lamb chops or steak. Drink now–2020."
US,91,43.0,Syrah,Palmeri,"Palmeri has a good history with Syrah, and this 2011 is right up there. With rich, complex blackberry and blueberry jam, cassis, salted grilled beef, black pepper and smoky oak flavors, it is sophisticated enough to drink with upscale fare. It should age well through 2020."
Portugal,91,28.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal,"A powerfully tannic wine, full of the mineral texture and dark structure of a fine Douro wine. It has rich berry and plum skin flavors with underlining from acidity. The tannins, still young, promise aging. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,91,75.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,"Already impressive, this wine is rich and packed with tannins and fruit. The structure gives a dry core that is cushioned by the sweet blackberry fruit flavors. The end shows the tannins again, along with fresh acidity, both suggesting aging. Drink from 2016."
Germany,91,20.0,Riesling,Emil Reichart,"Dried herbs accent notes of lemon and apple on this concentrated off-dry Riesling. The palate builds in intensity, with juicy flavors of peach and tangerine glazed with streaks of honey and wax. The finish is long, with bristling lemon-lime acidity."
Portugal,91,30.0,Portuguese Red,Casal da Coelheira,"With a significant proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a solid, tannic wine. It is also rich, complex and fruity. Fermentation in open lagares gives extra fruitiness, soft extract and great acidity. Drink from 2017."
France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Quinault L'Enclos,"A very ripe wine with a velvet texture, cut with acidity and wood aging flavors. There is fine concentration, with delicious, juicy Merlot giving a ripe feel. It presents a fresh aftertaste, with the black currant fruit giving a lift to the more tannic structure. Drink from 2017."
France,91,,Gamay,Domaine de Leyre-Loup,"A perfumed wine, it has structured black fruits and a solid texture. It is rich, showing complexity through its tannins along with acidity and fruitiness. Still surprisingly young to taste, it should not be drunk until 2015."
Germany,91,24.0,Lemberger,Grafen Neipperg,"Whiffs of blackberry, bramble and granite seduce throughout this concentrated, brawny Lemberger. The palate is lush, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors anchored by brooding minerality and a bite of firm tannins on the finish. It's lovely now, but should reveal more complexity with 5–7 years in the cellar."
Chile,91,100.0,Red Blend,Koyle,"Dark berry, shoe polish and lemony oak are at the center of the bouquet on this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. The palate feels rich to the point of syrupy, while the flavor profile offers a condensed, jammy mix of wild berries, wood, herbs, chocolate and coffee. Additional herbal notes along with spicy flavors carry a thick finish to its conclusion. Drink through 2018."
Chile,91,30.0,Red Blend,Maquis,"Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019."
Italy,91,26.0,Turbiana,Olivini,"Still youthful, it shows aromas of fragrant white flowers, stone fruit and pear. The juicy, lively palate delivers golden apples, yellow peach, almond and hints of aromatic herbs alongside fresh acidity. It boasts balance and finesse. Drink now through 2016."
US,91,65.0,Pinot Noir,Anam Cara,"This is a lovely, balanced wine, combining grip, texture and elegant details. It starts with clean fruit flavors of berry and cherry, bringing in delicate notes of root beer, vanilla and clove. There's a suggestion of brine also, the whole delivering marvelous complexity."
Chile,91,100.0,Petit Verdot,Von Siebenthal,"An intriguing, well-made wine, it conveys saucy red-fruit aromas that come with notes of raw oak, leather and herbs. It smacks the palate with hard tannins and raw verve, while flavors of vanilla, mocha, licorice and berry fruits finish crisp and woody. Drink through 2017."
Italy,91,30.0,Red Blend,Campo di Sasso,"This delicious blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, berries, tilled soil, blue flower and spice. The concentrated palate delivers fleshy black cherry, red currants, black pepper and graphite alongside smooth tannins. The long finish closes on a licorice note."
Portugal,91,,Portuguese Red,Emilio Moro,"Made by a Spanish bodega with grapes from the Portuguese Douro, this is a sophisticated Douro wine that has a smooth, ripe texture underpinned with dry tannins. Now mature, it's very elegant. Drink now."
US,91,48.0,Pinot Noir,Failla,"Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward."
Portugal,91,,Portuguese White,Fiuza,"This sophisticated wine is full of rich, beautifully integrated tropical and citrus fruits enhanced by an elegant use of wood. It feels rich, sumptuous and concentrated, while allowing for good acidity at the end. Drink from 2015."
Portugal,91,26.0,Petite Verdot,Herdade das Servas,"A big, ripe wine, it shows richness from the superripe grapes. It is bold, full-bodied and packed with juicy black fruits. It's like a fruit bomb, but structure holds it together. Drink from 2015."
Portugal,91,,Touriga Nacional,Herdade de São Miguel,"At this stage, this wine is dominated by wood. The black fruits underneath will take their time to bring together a wine that will show great perfumes, flavors of mushroom and truffles, and a dense texture. The aftertaste already has some of the right juicy acidity. Drink from 2017."
Portugal,91,16.0,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca,"This wine is just starting out. With its initially austere structure and firm tannins, the juicy fruitiness and mineral character are still waiting to emerge. It will be a serious and structured wine in the next few years, evoking the granite of the Douro. Drink from 2016."
US,91,42.0,Pinot Noir,La Follette,"You can call this Pinot thin, or you can call it elusive. While it does show the lean profile of the 2011 vintage, it's quite complex, offering high acid-inspired flavors of raspberry sour candy, chamomile tea and cranberries, plus minerally, dried herb complexities. Drinking through 2020."
Italy,88,60.0,Nebbiolo,460 Casina Bric,"Closed cellar aromas burn off to reveal black fruit, baking spices and balsamic notes. The palate is subdued, showing raw cherry-berry, cooking spices and herbs alongside nervous acidity and astringent tannins."
Italy,88,56.0,Nebbiolo,Anna Maria Abbona,"This earthy Barolo has funky sensations of game, meat juices, oak, vanilla, spice and ripe black berry fruit. The warm midpalate and sweet fruit are balanced by tightly packed, astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dry. Drink after 2020."
US,88,19.0,Pinot Noir,River's Edge,"Pale in color, it has pleasing aromas that mix fruit and barrel with notes of cinnamon, cherry and sarsaparilla. The palate is medium bodied with the oak (30% new French and American) getting just a bit out front of the fruit flavors."
US,88,21.0,Merlot,Robert Mondavi,"Complex and grippy, it offers classic layers of spicy black pepper, clove and red cherry and plum fruit. Not overpowering on the palate or in price, it will pair with flair."
US,88,20.0,Pinot Noir,Stoller,"This offers fresh fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. Delicate and flavorful, it's perfect for sipping on your porch, deck, boat or simply while picnicking."
US,88,25.0,Cabernet Franc,Tarara,"Ripe and fragrant, this offers delineated scents of cherry pie filling, raspberry, rose and dillweed. It's lithe and succulent, with polished lines and plenty of charm."
US,88,72.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The Williamsburg Winery,"Medium to full in weight, it offers sleek acids and highly buffed tannins. Subdued notes of charred herb, dark cherry and tobacco give character to this blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, 28% Petit Verdot."
Argentina,88,18.0,Torrontés,Trapiche,"This is lightly perfumed with green melon, lychee and papaya aromas. The palate is middle of the road in terms of acidity and snap. Flavors of lychee, peach and nectarine are typical of the variety, while the finish is plump and smooth."
US,88,70.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,V. Sattui,"Dark and viscous, this blends 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with 26% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. All settle into a high percentage of new French oak, which lends the wine a brawny, savory leather mouthfeel. The flavors tend toward olive, black pepper and cedar, a powerhouse in all."
Argentina,88,29.0,Cabernet Franc,Verum,"Smooth, earthy, lightly herbal aromas are balanced by fresh red-berry notes. This feels racy and lean in the mouth, with nothing fat or grabby getting in the way of steady raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. A note of olive and leafy green rises up on the finish."
Portugal,88,35.0,Portuguese Red,Vinha Paz,"The wines has concentration, while also having rich, smooth fruits that exude blackberries, fresh acidity and just the right amount of wood to give complexity.  It's firm, but ready to drink."
Bulgaria,88,10.0,Pinot Noir,Vini,"This dark cherry-red wine has aromas of red plums and dried black plums that flow to the palate. An easy drinking wine, with pleasantly tart cherry flavors."
US,88,26.0,Mourvèdre,Winery by the Creek,"This grape variety originated in Spain and is also popular in the southern Rhône Valley of France. In this bottling, smoky, chocolaty aromas lead to blackberry and dark cherry flavors, a broad, generous texture and moderate tannins. It's rather big in structure but not heavy."
Italy,88,28.0,Nebbiolo,Natale Verga,"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020."
Argentina,88,12.0,Torrontés,Quara,"Quara makes good, true Cafayate Torrontés. Aromas of lychee, citrus, tropical fruits and bath oils are vital. This remains solid and clean, with upright acidity. Lime, mango, lychee and banana flavors finish round, with just enough acidity to maintain the wine's character. Drink immediately."
Spain,88,25.0,Mencía,Losada,"While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese."
Australia,88,25.0,Chardonnay,Heggies Vineyard,"Hints of lemon curd and struck flint emerge from they lass, while the palate reveals flavors of apple, pear and citrus. With its pared-back flavors and restrained nature, this medium-bodied Chardonnay should prove versatile at the table. Drink now–2016."
US,88,19.0,Merlot,North Gate,"The scents of humus, spiced blackberry and char are deep, delineated and balanced. Fine-grained tannins and lifting acids unfurl across the poised palate, and the long finish concludes with black raspberry and vanilla notes."
Croatia,88,27.0,Posip,Bibich,"This Croatian white has delightful aromas of pineapple, tropical fruits and fresh cut honeycomb. It's round and generous in the mouth, with flavors of guava and lime rind that lead in to the clean, astringent finish."
US,88,12.0,Zinfandel,Castle Rock,"The somewhat light red-purple color does not mean that this medium-bodied wine lacks flavor. Toasty, smoky, caramel aromas from oak carry over to the bold and almost sweet flavors, powering over moderate raspberry and plum undertones."
France,88,15.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Peugeais,"This rich wine offers spice and black plum fruit flavors in equal measure. It's certainly ripe, but a fresher character adds lift. Tannins are already well-integrated into this velvet-textured wine. Drink from 2017."
Romania,88,9.0,Pinot Noir,Cramele Halewood,"Aromas of cherry, raspberry and a whiff of mint lead to flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and strawberry in this easy quaffing Pinot Noir."
US,88,22.0,Chardonnay,Deep Sea,"A complex nose emerges as this wine opens up with chalk, soda, lemon and lime pith. The scents go well with the ocean breezes at Deep Sea's tasting room on Santa Barbara's wharf. It's lean on the palate, with lime throughout and a bit of papaya on the end."
France,88,37.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Vacheron,"The ripe and fruity style typical of Vacheron wines is evident here. Citrus flavors are given a rich fillip by yellow fruits and a rounded, full texture. Touches of minerality and youthful acidity are already well integrated into the body of the wine. Drink in 2015."
US,88,19.0,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi,"Inviting in tropical aromas of guava and pineapple, it smells sweet but drinks dry, balanced in melon and high-toned citrus, just a hint of grass on the finish."
France,88,,Sauvignon Blanc,Roger et Didier Raimbault,"This is a fresh, lemony wine, crisp and steely. A richer element rounds out the tight texture and acidity. Lively and fruity, it will be ready to drink in 2015."
Italy,88,,Nebbiolo,Sarotto,"Sweet vanilla, oak, espresso, coconut and plum aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate. The sugary vanilla and toasted oak flavors mask the Nebbiolo purity, while bracing tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out."
US,88,40.0,Pinot Noir,Schug,"It offers an imprint of spearmint, dill and black cherry fruit, a modicum of tannins and a soft side, the aroma replete in rose petals. On the finish expect a darker influence of tobacco and oak."
Italy,88,,Nebbiolo,Simone Scaletta,"Aromas of ripe plum, rose petals, cake spices and toasted oak lead the nose on this structured wine. The rich palate opens with a burst of dark cherry fruit followed by accents of roasted coffee bean, espresso, and vanilla. The succulent midpalate is cut short by astringent wood tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out."
US,88,70.0,Pinot Noir,Tantara,"Winemaker Jeff Fink is unleashing a cross-section of clones in 2012, and this take on Pommard offers delicious aromas of berry-laced crème brûlée with bay leaf. There is a bitterness at first on the tannic palate, and it washes out quickly with tart cranberries."
US,87,34.0,Merlot,Sevtap,"Very rich aromas of cherry, blueberry syrup and hot blackberry jam-filled pastry greet the nose. So the sour cherry and tart cranberry flavors are surprising on this medium-bodied wine, which also picks up interesting peppery notes into a lingering finish."
US,87,38.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sevtap,"The nose on this wine by oil worker-turned-winemaker Ert Sevtap offers lifting aromas of blueberry and mint. The spearmint notes carry to the palate as well, which also shows blackberry fruit and roasted beef meatiness."
US,87,14.0,Chardonnay,Sheldrake Point,"A touch of caramelized sugar lingers from nose to finish on this brisk wine, melding into layers of white peach, caramel and cream. It's light in body, but the mouthfeel is surprisingly round and rich. The finish is zesty and bright."
US,87,20.0,Zinfandel,Thurston Wolfe,"With all of the fruit hailing from Zephyr Ridge Vineyard, this wine is lighter in color, with suggestions of ash, cigar box, vanilla, coffee and red fruit. It's soft in feel, flavorful yet still quite deft. Good acidity backs it all up, finishing warm."
US,87,30.0,Nebbiolo,Wilridge,"Aromatically intriguing, this carries suggestions of sour cherry, umami and fresh tobacco. The palate brings medium-bodied cranberry and cherry flavors. It doesn't have the tannic structure that this variety is known for but there is still plenty to enjoy."
US,87,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wölffer,"Prominent streaks of spice, toast and smoke persist amidst tart black cherry and cassis flavors in this full-bodied wine. Pomegranate acidity is bracing on the midpalate, accentuating a slightly brusque finish."
Spain,87,15.0,Monastrell,Finca Hispana,"Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Chantemerle,"Ripe Cabernet gives this wine a great start in life. Juicy black currant is underpinned by the wood aging and tannins, giving a wine that is fruity while still structured. Drink from 2017."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Bensse,"While the wine has plenty of the tannins typical of 2011 at this stage, it also has ripe fruit, full of blackberry and currant flavors. The balance is already there, giving a potentially rich, juicy and generous wine. Drink from 2017."
US,87,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Lafayette Reneau,"Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish."
France,87,35.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lalaudey,"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mancèdre,"This firm and dry wine is also full of acidity. A juicy start is then given a firm jolt by the tannins, but the complex structure allows plenty of room for the bright fruits. Drink from 2018."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Peyfaures,"Fresh and juicy, this full-bodied while structured wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, which gives the fruitiness and blackberry fruit flavors. It will develop quickly and can be drunk from 2016."
US,87,23.0,Syrah,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards,"This moderately aromatic wine conveys Red Hots, baking spices and red fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft yet full of drawn-out blue-fruit flavors on the finish."
US,87,24.0,Riesling,Balo,"With aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple skin, peach skin, white pepper and pomegranate seed, this tastes crisp, tangy, slightly bitter, and has great bright acidity. It is light to medium bodied and made from 100% whole-cluster-pressed Riesling that was fermented in a combination of older oak barrels and stainless steel vessels."
US,87,16.0,Chardonnay,Byron,"Toffee, cinnamon apples and a hefty swirl of smoke arise on the nose from the winery's entry-level bottling. The palate shows caramelized pears, nicely bitter lemon rinds and warm, buttered nut toffee note that carries from first sip to the finish."
Italy,87,24.0,White Blend,Giorgio Meletti Cavallari,"A blend of 60% Vermentino and 40% Viognier, this presents a delicate fragrance of honeysuckle and stone fruit. The bright palate offers creamy white peach and tangerine, with a candied ginger note on the close."
US,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Gundlach Bundschu,"An unidentified mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot sourced from throughout the county, this is a smoky, leathery expression of sanguine black and red fruit that's approachable and easygoing. The finish has a bittersweet note of chicory."
US,87,12.0,White Blend,Kitchen Sink,"Subdued is a good way to describe this light-bodied white made from Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Gewürztraminer. It has subtle aromas of honey and flowers, fresh but quiet peach flavors and a soft texture."
US,87,20.0,Riesling,Heron Hill,"While spry and dry in style, fragrant apricot and orange blossom notes lend flair to this light-bodied wine. Tangerine acidity is bright and concentrated on the palate, leading to a swift, pert finish."
US,87,28.0,Merlot,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish."
France,87,27.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Vieux Moulin,"This concentrated, structured wine has an earthy quality, typical of some Listracs, along with a more juicy, fruity character that's boosted by acidity. Balanced, it will age over the medium-term. Drink from 2017."
US,87,22.0,White Blend,Murrieta's Well,"Fresh apple aromas and lively citrus flavors make a good combination in this light-bodied, tangy-textured wine. It tastes slightly rounded with sweetness, but comes off clean, crisp and appetizing. The two main components are Sémillon and Chardonnay, with dashes of Sauvignon Blanc and Orange Muscat."
US,87,50.0,Red Blend,Northstar,"This wine is predominantly Merlot (83%) along with Cabernet Sauvignon (9%) and Syrah (2%) all from Anna Marie Vineyard, with Cabernet Franc from Minnick Hills and Petit Verdot from StoneTree Vineyard. Pleasing aromas suggest blueberry, milk chocolate and high-toned herbs. It's elegantly styled with light blue-fruit flavors, at times seeming a bit faint."
US,87,28.0,Roussanne,Sarah's Vineyard,"This offers an intriguing mix of ripe Golden Delicious apples and a strong alkalinity characterized by crushed chalk. The palate holds tight to a lime-pith line, proving racy and lean, with just a drizzle of honey. It would be great with shellfish."
US,87,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stickybeak,"Sanguine in cassis, cranberry and wild strawberry, this relatively inexpensive Napa Cab has an herbal edge that suggests elegance and balance. The finish is stamped in oak that lingers on the palate without overwhelming."
US,87,40.0,Touriga Nacional,Patterson,The alcohol—19% as labeled—shows prominently on the aromas of this 88% Touriga Nacional and 12% Sauzao single-vineyard wine from Lonesome Springs Ranch Vineyard. Sweet chocolate and dark fruit flavors offer plenty of appeal.
US,87,18.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pedroncelli,"Medium in weight, this offers a richness of plum and medium acidity surrounded by sizable tannin and oak. Cherry, dark currant and leather round out the characteristics, the wine aged in both French and American oak. The price is nice."
Italy,87,23.0,Sangiovese,Perazzeta,"This Sangiovese features aromas of blue flower, dark berry and a balsamic note. The extracted palate delivers dried black cherry, ground pepper and espresso alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish."
US,87,14.0,Merlot,Waterbrook,"Lighter in color and 100% varietal, this wine offers high-toned notes of plum, cinnamon stick and licorice. The blue and red fruit flavors are broad in feel with a light squeeze on tannins."
Spain,90,15.0,Tempranillo,Palacio del Burgo,"Charred, earthy black-fruit aromas are smoky and power-packed. This feels full yet balanced, with freshness and strong tannins. Ripe berry, prune and oak-spice flavors finish with a note of vanilla and length. For a Crianza from a tough vintage, this is commendable."
US,90,26.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Passaggio,"This light-bodied wine has aromas of grapefruit and prosciutto, flavors of melon and toasted almond, making it one of the most interesting and complex versions around. Its balance is good, its texture crisp and its finish lingering."
Spain,90,20.0,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega,"Widely available Rioja Crianzas don't come much better than this. An opening of raspberry and strawberry aromas backed by direct cherry, raspberry and red-plum flavors render this all about fruit and freshness."
US,90,20.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sketchbook,"This is a serious and satisfying dry wine with bold flavors, great structure and a mouth-filling texture. It is very well balanced in terms of fruit character and displays moderate tannins, good acidity and no excesses. It's easy to imagine on the table with a grilled rib eye."
US,90,50.0,Mourvèdre,Adelaida Cellars,"This is a richer take on the grape, with aromas of baked cherries, pie crust, allspice, nutmeg and a touch of bacon fat.

France,90,56.0,Pinot Noir,Domaine Faiveley,"With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018."
France,90,,Pinot Noir,Domaine René Bouvier,"With intense acidity, this wine has both good structure and red currant and raspberry fruits. It is bright, fresh and almost crisp in character. In the background, the tannins show the dense texture of the wine. It will need to age, so don't drink before 2019."
US,90,42.0,Grenache,Casa Dumetz,"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come."
Chile,90,27.0,Syrah,Rios de Chile,"Pretty on the nose, with floral notes to go with plum, cherry and minerally aromas. While this is tannic as nails, it's super tasty, with mocha, blackberry and coffee flavors. Hard residual tannins make for a rough exit, but there's enough ripe fruit to make this work. Drink through 2021."
Germany,90,30.0,Riesling,Robert Weil,"Laser-edged mineral tones cut a crystalline edge through this bristling, honey-kissed Kabinett. Equal parts sweet and tart, it packs a punch of crisp tangerine and lemon refreshment."
US,90,28.0,Chardonnay,Scar of the Sea,"Winemakers Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli are the first to admit that this is an odd style of wine, but people are digging the pét-nat style. Aromas of sour apple, grass and passion fruit arise while the palate's very tight, bubbles unleash exotic tropical fruits like green papaya and green banana."
US,90,32.0,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim,"Deceptively light and tight when first opened, this wine has flavors and character more in line with Gamay than most Pinots. Tart cranberry and raspberry fruit carries into a tangy finish, with citrus, mineral and herbal highlights."
France,90,35.0,Pinot Noir,Boeckel,"With a little airing, this wakes up to reveal dark red cherries held in a taut and firm body that nonetheless has a generous core. There is some gentle grip and frank, firm acidity. It's a very honest wine without any baroque frills—but bags of forthright appeal."
Germany,90,19.0,Müller-Thurgau,Fritz Müller,"Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco. Made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, it's gorgeously floral, but with a chalky, earthen tang. Sprightly acidity and a fresh, green touch lends vibrance to a moderately long finish."
France,90,70.0,Pinot Noir,Nicolas Potel,"This is a tight, fruity wine with high levels of acidity. That is certainly typical of the vintage and brings out very young red currant and berry fruit flavors. Even though the tannins are light, the wine is definitely one to age, so should not be drunk before 2020."
US,90,25.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Ousterhout,"Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood."
US,90,40.0,Syrah,Peju,"This is a nice, full-bodied red with 3% Petit Verdot. Licorice, lavender and peppery leather gather around soft, pliable tannins and meaty blackberry fruit, finding length and breadth along the way."
US,90,90.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sequoia Grove,"Tonella has 16% Merlot within, from the estate vineyard around the winery. Cedar, currant and dried herb greet the nose and palate before allowing chalky, dusty tannin to season layers of chocolate and black cherry, staying structured and bright from start to finish."
US,90,45.0,Chardonnay,Sleeping Giant,"Dark gold in color, this wine was whole-cluster pressed and fermented for a lengthy six months, providing for a luxuriousness of stone fruit and melon dripping in honey and caramel. It's ripe and fleshy, with a slight voluptuousness. Aged in 50% new French oak for 17 months."
US,90,19.0,Pinot Gris,Sokol Blosser,"Dense and textural, this immediately displays a strong minerality, in its mouthfeel and racy freshness. It further amplifies the tart, tight fruit flavors of apple and citrus, grapefruit and pineapple."
US,90,25.0,Gewürztraminer,Stolo,"Orange blossoms, night jasmine, ripe Pink Lady apples and a touch of bubblegum pop on the nose of this bottling from a coastal canyon vineyard behind Cambria. The palate shows a fine-tuned and textural grip, offering similar floral flavors as well as a botanical streak that shows a touch of pine needle and goes deep into the finish."
,90,17.0,Assyrtiko,Tsililis,"Delicate white flowers and a spin of lemon peel on the nose start this refined white. The bright fruit on the palate is tropical and exotic, but the minerality gives it lift. Fuller-bodied but poised, the wine has aging potential and a food-friendly character."
France,90,15.0,Pinot Blanc,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"Very subtle hints of ripe, red apple hover above the glass. They become more apparent and richer on the slightly spiced palate that also shows hints of pepper and saffron. There is concentration on the palate and ample definition and structure provided by clean, brisk freshness."
France,90,45.0,Pinot Auxerrois,Josmeyer,"Lovely notes of Reineclaude plums play on the nose. The palate is soft but also has echoes of pebble and stone. Fluid and fresh, the wine even shows overtones of white blossom on the palate. It's a lovely, lasting and authentic expression of Alsace."
France,90,21.0,Pinot Blanc,Josmeyer,"A certain faint spiciness hovers over everything, recalling honeysuckle. The textured palate is fresh and equally pepper-spiced. This has freshness and verve, a certain ease and tons of lemony crispness. If you wanted to hold a party to welcome summer, this would be the perfect wine."
US,90,22.0,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains."
US,90,56.0,Cabernet Franc,Chateau Margene,"Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes."
Slovenia,90,15.0,Ribolla Gialla,Colliano,"This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple. It is soft on entry, rounded in the mouth and shows good minerality on the finish."
Italy,90,,Sangiovese,La Togata,"Underbrush, pipe tobacco, blue-flower, berry and star anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm, elegant palate offers dried cherry, clove, mint and orange peel alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2025."
Italy,90,70.0,Sangiovese,Le Macioche,"This wine opens with aromas of baked plum, leather, underbrush, grilled herb and a toasted note. The ripe, chewy palate offers raspberry jam, fleshy black cherry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside solid tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,90,40.0,Chardonnay,Loring Wine Company,"Baked pears, tangerine oil and wet-cement minerality show on the nose of this rich yet balanced wine from one of the region's premiere sites. The palate shows Gala apples, honeysuckle and blood-orange rinds, blending ripeness with grippy tartness."
US,90,85.0,Pinot Noir,MacPhail,"An estate-grown wine in its second vintage, this comes from the cooler-climate hills of the coast. This plush wine is dark brown in color and brimming in stinky earth—a rich, funky and concentrated expression that's herbal, spicy and shy in raspberry fruit."
US,90,24.0,Chardonnay,Mahoney,"Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish."
US,90,26.0,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek,"From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond."
US,90,46.0,Petit Verdot,Merry Cellars,"Vanillla, baking spice and dried herb aromas are at the forefront. The dark-fruit flavors are dense, supported by lively acids and firm but well integrated tannins. It's a delicious example of the variety."

Italy,90,85.0,Sangiovese,Poggio Nardone,"Aromas of charred earth, toast, ground pepper, mature black-skinned fruit and espresso lead the nose. The big, ripe palate presents licorice, fleshy black cherry, clove and tobacco alongside a tannic backbone."
Moldova,90,32.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Purcari,"The blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 15% Malbec has well-balanced tannins and scents of black raspberry, vanilla and caramel. Sweet vanilla, cherry pie and blueberries are the predominant tastes."
US,90,36.0,Port,Robert Hall,"This blend of 32% Alvarelhão, 31% Souzão, 24% Touriga and 13% Tinta Cão shows baked black cherries, licorice, gingerbread, iron and smashed asphalt on the nose. The palate is soft and rich, with jammy cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors eloquently spiced by clove, framed by silky tannins and cut with a welcome acidity."
US,90,16.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Robert Hall,"The first of the vintage to be tasted from the region, this bottling is a promising sign. Fresh-cut green apples, Anjou pear skins, honeydew, bubblegum, wet stone and whiffs of cut grass show on the nose. There's lots of verve to the palate, with white pepper, apple skin and slight jalapeño flavors. It's perfect for shellfish and salads."
France,90,35.0,Pinot Noir,Roger et Didier Raimbault,"A ripe and rich wine, this is full of jammy red fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruits, giving a smooth, ripe wine that's developing attractively. With a juicy, fresh aftertaste, it is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
Italy,90,80.0,Sangiovese,San Polo,"Aromas of menthol, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit come together on this accessible, full-bodied red. The ripe, chewy palate offers cherries marinated in spirits, blackberry jam, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate."
US,90,20.0,Riesling,Single Wheel,"Intensely tropical aromas extend into the palate of this exuberantly ripe, fruity off-dry Riesling. Hibiscus-nectar sweetness intensifies luscious white peach and melon flavors, but is offset squarely by a dazzling streak of lemony acidity. It's juicy and satisfying through a long finish."
US,90,15.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Substance,Abundant dried and fresh herb aromas are followed by notes of black currant and blackberry. The palate brings full-feeling black-fruit flavors that provide instant appeal. It's a crowd pleaser.
India,90,13.0,Shiraz,Sula,"Dark violet-red in color, this wine has a bouquet of blueberry, brambles and flint. It is soft on entry, with a web of tannins that spreads across the palate. Flavors of cherry preserves, bacon and juniper berry are at play in the mouth, and bright fruit notes and tactile tannins come in waves through the lingering finish."
US,90,20.0,Red Blend,Troublemaker by Austin Hope,"This blend of 71% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 8% Zinfandel, 3% Petite Sirah and 2% Mourvèdre stands up to Paso blends three times its price. Broad aromas of plum, olallieberry and dried cherry mix with vanilla, dill and herbes de Provence on the nose. The creamy palate conveys boysenberry and blackberry seasoned by lavender and white pepper."
US,90,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,V. Sattui,"A soft, chewy and smoky vineyard-designate, this wine is defined by a depth and breadth of sizable tannin, black plum and chocolate, celebrating ripeness and voluptuous in a glass."
US,90,55.0,Chardonnay,William Hill Estate,"An expansive, full-bodied and generously rich wine, this features present but integrated oak. Aromas of orange blossom and jasmine rise slowly out of the glass to lighten the experience, polished in bites of green apple and pineapple."
Italy,90,22.0,Sangiovese,Luiano,"Wild cherry, rose, spice and chopped sage aromas come together on this round, savory wine. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, star anise and a coffee note set in a framework of polished tannins. Drink through 2018."
Italy,90,20.0,Red Blend,Villa Mangiacane,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 5% Canaiolo, this offers pretty aromas of pressed rose, violet, berry, menthol and a whiff of ground cooking spice. The linear palate offers mature black cherry, orange zest, clove, white pepper, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Spain,90,30.0,Tempranillo,Maset del Lleó,"Black fruits, fine herbs and horsehide carry the aromas of this offering. In the mouth, this is firm and well built, with integrated tannins. Savory flavors of soy sauce and roast plum share space with bolder, riper cherry notes, while a warm, earthy finish tastes of roasted plum and berry. Drink through 2021."
Italy,90,30.0,Red Blend,Salcheto,"Mostly Sangiovese with 5% Colorino and made by refermenting with partially dried grapes, this wine offers aromas of dried plum, clove, scorched earth and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and a note of ground pepper that lead to a firm finish."

US,90,35.0,Rosé,Adair Bachman,"This is made from 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Pinot Noir, an interesting and fulfilling combination thats robust on the palate. Pinkish-orange in color, it's both tangy and weighty, finishing dry in orange zest."
US,90,48.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Apriori,"Black-olive tapenade is the star of this show, along with fig, black currant and cedar. Bittersweet cocoa accents the powerful tannin and integrated oak, before finishing velvety smooth."
France,90,43.0,Chardonnay,Au Pied du Mont Chauve,"There is a toasty aroma in this wine that comes from a premier cru next door to Chassagne-Montrachet. This toastiness continues into a spicy, toasty note. A good sense of fruitiness gives the wine a ripe and rich character that will allow it to mature well. Drink from 2017."
US,90,18.0,Gewürztraminer,Bellangelo,"Lusciously ripe mango and lychee aromas introduce this unusually sprightly Gewürztraminer. Perfumed and delicately sweet, but not at all cloying, it's vivacious and thirst quenching, finishing on a enticingly astringent tea-leaf note. Drink now through 2018."
US,93,32.0,Syrah,Waxwing,"From the cool plains of the Petaluma Gap, this wine shines in violet and blueberry crumble aromas. Light bodied, it reveals deeper, darker pepper steak-like flavors as it opens, finishing on an elegant aftertaste of clove."
New Zealand,93,46.0,Chardonnay,Kumeu River,"Usually the bigger, more opulent of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, the 2015 version of the Coddington is medium to full in weight, but strikingly focused and vibrant. Bacony smoke notes frame white peach flavors, finishing long."
France,93,40.0,Malbec,Château Eugénie,This premium cuvée from Eugénie is packed both with superripe fruit and layers of wood aging flavors. The fruit of this impressive wine is still pushing through the dark tannins that give a dry dusty edge to the wine. It is powerful and rich and should age. Drink from 2020.
France,93,20.0,Tannat-Cabernet,Château Peyros,"Vines up to 50-years-old are the basis of this rich and tannic wine. While it does have some age, it still has a way to go. Big bold tannins show strongly along with ripe black-plum skins. The wood aging has given this wine a smooth elegant edge that contrasts with the still young fruitiness. Drink from 2021."
US,93,55.0,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker,"Rich red cherry, rhubarb and alpine strawberry aromas meet rust and shaved licorice on the nose of this beautiful bottling from the Parker family's cool-climate vineyard. It's deceptively light on the palate, with airy flavors that intensify to exotic cherry, mulberry, tea leaf and maduro cigar, framed by firm, structured tannins. Drink 2020–2024."
US,93,94.0,Chardonnay,Grgich Hills,"This wine comes from one of the producer's oldest blocks in Carneros, where grapes retain vibrant acidity. Reduced on the nose, it opens up into a mix of fennel, preserved lemon and almond aromas that follow through on the steely palate with grace."
US,93,40.0,Syrah,Hard Six Cellars,"From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast. That peppery quality follows through on the palate, buoyed by juicy acidity and smoothly layered blackberry, tobacco and tea flavors. Exquisitely made and worth seeking out."
US,93,37.0,Pinot Noir,Patricia Green Cellars,"The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A riot of berries, plums and Asian spices fills the mouth—well-integrated, layered and detailed right on through the extended finish. A light dusting of cocoa powder lingers and invites the next sip."
US,93,44.0,Pinot Noir,Samuel Louis Smith,"Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill."
Austria,93,,Blaufränkisch,Schwarz Wein,"Wonderfully aromatic fruit rises from the glass: blueberry with cinnamon and violet overtones, hints of plum and pepper and a pervasive elderberry note. This is a wonderfully elegant medium-bodied wine with a distinct but unobtrusive structure that lets the fruit speak clearly and honestly. Fresh and elegant now, it's sure to develop and evolve. Drink now–2025."
US,93,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Smith-Madrone,"From dry-farmed estate vines, this savory, classically styled red offers nuances of cedar, dried herb and peppercorn. It's aromatically reminiscent of the forest that surrounds the estate, delivering a balanced landscape of subtle, elegant flavor and length."
Austria,93,27.0,Pinot Noir,Malat,"The floral, vanilla tone of new oak marries with ripe, red cherry notes in this wine, supported by clove and violet highlights. It's young and taut on the palate, its fine tannins still firm and crunchy, needing time to evolve and relax. Pure fruit and the pervasive freshness promise a bright future. Drink 2019–2025."
US,93,32.0,Malbec,Waters,"This wine offers aromas of herb, tobacco, barrel spice and plum. The palate brings plush rich textured plum flavors, showing a beautiful sense of purity along with a crazy-long finish. It's a shamelessly delicious but still impeccably balanced wine that is nearly impossible to put down."
Argentina,93,38.0,Cabernet Blend,Luigi Bosca,"Ripe but subtle aromas of aged balsamic vinegar, blackberry, baked plum and vanilla are alluring and feed into a flush layered palate. Spicy black plum and berry flavors are just rustic and toasty enough, while this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Merlot tastes peppery, deep, a touch hot and on the money. Drink from 2018–2026."
New Zealand,93,33.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Spy Valley,"Envoy is Spy Valley's top range of bottlings. In this case, it's a single-vineyard wine that's fermented and matured in oak for 11 months. It's medium-bodied and silky in texture, with distinctive fumé notes, hints of struck match, and layers of passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. Dry, austere and long on the finish, it's a compelling example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc."
New Zealand,93,40.0,Riesling,Felton Road,"This wine shows a fine balance between sweetness (74 g/L) and acidity, reminiscent of a spätlese style. Striking scents of crushed stone, beeswax and lime burst from the glass, while the flavors combine peach and citrus notes. The finish shines, marrying sugar and acid into a long, tongue-tingling finale."
US,93,36.0,White Blend,Barden,"This blend of 35% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Blanc and 30% Pinot Gris from La Encantada Vineyard is a stunner, starting with its crystalline brilliance in the glass. Lime blossom, pomelo, baking soda and lanolin aromas lead into a grippy palate of green apple, chalk and wet cement. Extremely tense and compelling."
US,93,35.0,Chardonnay,Bergström,"This cuvée, says winemaker Josh Bergström, is crafted to compete with village Burgundies. Principally Temperance Hill fruit, it more than does the job, with great mouthfeel, and a succulent tangy ripe mix of citrus and stone fruits. There's a lick of caramel apple coming through also, and the wine is bursting with bright flavors across the board."
US,93,60.0,Pinot Noir,Challen,"Actress Challen Cates got interested in wine when her father ran Tantara Winery. She's since hired winemaker Kevin Law to deliver great bottlings like this one. It's redolent with sarsaparilla, red plum, mulberry and cola, and shows deft balance on the palate, combining plum, cherry, licorice and ginger flavors."
Spain,93,37.0,Tempranillo,Bodegas Riojanas,"Aromas of roasted earth, leather and fine oak are more out-front than berry fruit, and that's the way it should be for a Gran Reserva. This feels bold, lively and still a touch bumpy. Chocolaty oak and vanilla notes rest comfortably on top of ripe berry and black-plum flavors, while the finish is persistently earthy and chocolaty. Drink through 2028."
Spain,93,44.0,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE,A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power. Blackberry and earthy notes finish stout and compact: this doesn't vary or waver on the back end. Best from 2019–2026.
Spain,93,136.0,Red Blend,Pago de Carraovejas,"A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030."
France,93,52.0,Rosé,Domaines Ott,"Dominated by the local Mourvèdre grapes, this is a ripe and complex wine. Its acidity is integrated with rich yellow fruits, spice and perfume. The wine is floral, poised and very stylish. Drink from late 2017."
US,93,48.0,Chardonnay,FEL,"Savory in aroma, richly fruity and accented with butter and vanilla, this wine has a complete package of flavors and an expert balance to accompany its creamy viscosity. It combines lightly toasty, earthy notes with generous pear and citrus flavors in a way that's unusual and compelling. Best after 2020."
Italy,93,80.0,Aglianico,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Forest floor, leather, tilled soil, ripe berry and balsam are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The smooth, dense palate delivers blackberry jam, espresso, licorice and ground pepper flavors, blanketed with soft, silky tannins. Tobacco and graphite notes linger on the finish. Drink through 2020."
US,93,30.0,Grenache,Koehler,"Juicy strawberry and red plum aromas meet cinnamon, sassafras and earthy scents in this bottling from winemaker Colin Murphy. Beautiful layers of sour cherry combine with dried fennel, wild mint, thyme and rose petal flavors on the palate, which finishes clean and crisp."
US,93,32.0,Syrah,Saviah,"A blend of fruit from Watermill, Funk, Lewis and Anna Marie vineyards, the aromas bring vibrant notes of flowers, ham hock, berry, tapenade, herb and ember. The palate is plush yet elegant and silky in feel, showing an exquisite mix of fruit and savory flavors along with outrageous hang time on the finish. It shows a lot of subtlety."
Austria,93,,Grüner Veltliner,Sohm & Kracher,"This wine's dried pear, hay and hayflower scents create an immediate impression of richness. The palate underlines all of these generous flavors with a unique, streamlined freshness that illuminates. This is what happens when good Grüner Veltliner benefits from a little bottle age: Its herbal, lifted allure comes to the fore. Savor this."
Austria,93,19.0,Pinot Noir,Stadlmann,"This wine's fresh, ripe red cherry and aromatic strawberry touches make for an inviting nose. The palate shows the same intense primary fruit, bolstered by freshness and a fine, filigreed structure. Its supple, pure fruit makes it very enjoyable now, but it's sure to evolve further with bottle age. Drink now–2025."
US,93,65.0,Pinot Noir,Testarossa,"From the vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families, this wine delivers bright raspberry and strawberry aromas with sweet star anise spice. The medium-bodied palate is lively and boisterous, with ripe cranberry, tangy red plum skin and sour cherry flavors, accented with a helping of dried herbs."
US,90,50.0,Pinot Noir,Argyle,"Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration."
US,90,32.0,Pinot Gris,Big Table Farm,"A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach."
Germany,90,23.0,Riesling,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,"A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Cantina del Nebbiolo,"Mature black fruit, toast and spice aromas lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound, offering baked black cherry, licorice and espresso balanced by youthfully assertive, taut tannins. Drink after 2019."
Italy,90,44.0,Nebbiolo,Cantina del Pino,"Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016."
Israel,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carmel,"A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate."
Portugal,90,13.0,Portuguese Red,Casa Santos Lima,"Produced from vines grown in a boulder and fossil strewn vineyard, this is a rich smoky wine. It has a deep color from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend, with firm tannins and dark juicy plum skin flavors. It's going to be a ripe rich wine as it develops. Drink from 2017."
US,90,15.0,Gewürztraminer,Château Bianca,"This lovely wine captures the floral, perfumed essence of the grape in a restrained, sippable style. It's dry and crisp, with lemony fruit and the delicate sensation that you are drinking fresh flowers."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Clavesana,"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, ripe berry, leather and a funky whiff of game. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, black raspberry, truffle, grilled sage, ground pepper and a hint of tobacco alongside youthfully assertive, solid tannins. Drink after 2018."
US,90,50.0,Pinot Noir,Clos LaChance,"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate."
Germany,90,22.0,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,"Juicy succulent tangerine and yellow peach flavors meld on the palate of this forward fruity off-dry wine. On first taste, it's quite straightforward, but added attention reveals glimmers of spice, saffron and mineral complexities. Drink now through 2024."
France,90,141.0,Chardonnay,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Situated in the center of the premier crus of Puligny, Champgains produces an elegant, textured wine. This bottling, with the warmth of 2013 behind it, is fragrant with white fruits and has a soft aftertaste. It needs to age to bring it out its more complex character, so wait until 2018."
France,90,74.0,Chardonnay,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"With its appealing toast and fruit aromas, this is a rich wine. It does keep plenty of steely texture while allowing the yellow fruits, ripe pear and toast to shine. In style it hovers halfway between the ripe, buttery Meursault of the past and the crisper style of today, a fine compromise and ready to drink now."
US,90,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Leto,"A minuscule amount of this wine is made, coming from 45-year-old vines. Ripe, dense and dusty red and black berries combine against soft, approachable layers of integrated tannin and oak, finishing with leather and cigar."
Italy,90,102.0,Nebbiolo,Luigi Oddero & Figli,"Aromas of pressed rose, dried berry, leather, chopped herb, cinnamon and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The subtle palate delivers dried black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside firm, ripe tannins. Enjoy sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness."
Italy,90,80.0,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"Aromas of mature black plum, espresso, wild rose and spice emerge on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, menthol, mint, white pepper, well-integrated oak and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
Italy,90,35.0,Nebbiolo,Mauro Sebaste,"Pressed rose petal, red berry, chopped herb and a whiff of exotic spice come together on this elegantly structured red. The medium-bodied palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink 2017–2023."
Italy,90,55.0,Nebbiolo,Mauro Veglio,"The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals dark berry, blue flower and brown baking spice. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, coffee, cocoa, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly packed tannins. Give this another two or three years to let the tannins unfurl, then enjoy."
Italy,90,50.0,Nebbiolo,Montaribaldi,"Rose, red berry, baked earth, forest floor and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, cake spice and anise. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2018–2026."
Israel,90,38.0,Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,Or Haganuz,"Offering aromas of black cherry and green pepper with a whiff of matchstick, this wine has flavors of black cherry, raspberry, smoked meat, mace and green tea. There is a good yin and yang of fruit and savory flavors, while chewy tannins wane at the first sign of orange zest on the bright finish."
US,90,42.0,Zinfandel,Papapietro Perry,"Blackberry and leather pouch jump from the glass from this full-bodied wine that stays light on its feet despite the generous ripeness. Cinnamon, black pepper and black licorice round out the flavors, finishing soft and with length."
US,90,26.0,White Blend,Paro,"Although this wine is listed as a white blend, the producer says the variety is Vernaccia, not found often in California. Light in alcohol and approach, it opens in a bouquet of waxy apple and Meyer lemon, followed by a medium-powered palate of pear. The finish is crisp and lean."
France,90,65.0,Champagne Blend,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils,"This pale-colored rosé is made from Chardonnay with the addition of Pinot Noir still wine to give the color. It is fresh and crisp, offering a lively mousse with attractive flavors of raspberry and fresh red currants. With its refreshing acidity, it is ready to drink."
Italy,90,70.0,Nebbiolo,Pietro Rinaldi,"Aromas of dark berry, tilled soil, underbrush and espresso lead the nose while the taut palate offers sour cherry, sage, white pepper and star anise. It's still tightly wound and nervous, with bracing tannins. Drink 2019–2029."
Italy,90,60.0,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare,"Aromas of oak extract, toast, red berry and espresso wrap around this structured wine. The firm palate offers up sour cherry, ground pepper and licorice alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028."
US,90,50.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond,"Dark plum and milk chocolate are the stars of this chalky, soft wine, almost entirely varietal, with a splash of Petit Verdot. Integrated oak helps make it approachable and fruit-forward, while the finish is subtle in fireplace smoke."
US,90,44.0,Red Blend,Red C,"In this blend, Cabernet Sauvignon was co-fermented with Petite Sirah, with 70% of the grapes grown in the Napa Valley. There's a compelling richness of earthy truffle and red berry in the wine, supported in full-bodied breadth by a grip of tannin. Bennett Valley Syrah and Dry Creek Merlot also figure into the mix."
US,90,60.0,Pinot Noir,Roco,"The regular bottling from the estate vineyard takes the spotlight in 2013, with a lightness and delicacy that in no way means it is simple or insubstantial. There's much to admire, from the silky cherry fruit to the dusty traces of sandalwood, saffron and butter brickle."
US,90,20.0,Pinot Noir,Swick,"All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature."
US,90,45.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Tablas Creek,"This blend of 71% Roussanne, 21% Grenache Blanc and 8% Picpoul Blanc offers cut Meyer lemon, tangerine and pink-grapefruit aromas on the nose, along with the promise of a creamy palate. Instead, the palate is quite tight and restrained, starting tart but opening toward lemon rinds and pear flesh, and wiping up clean on the finish."
France,92,34.0,Riesling,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"Still young, the wine is very mineral, smoky and tight, with considerable structure and concentration. The apple and citrus fruits are attractive, although almost a sideshow compared with the texture of the wine. Drink from 2017."
US,92,55.0,Chardonnay,Lynmar,"Creamy and lush, this offers currents of tropical coconut complemented by floral gardenia and pear. Made in a fuller style than some of the winery's other vineyard-specific wines, the generosity of fruit is expertly offset by searingly pleasant acidity, sustaining it sip after sip."
US,92,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sol Rouge,"From winemaker Bryan Kane, who also makes the Howell Mountain Vineyards' wines, comes this tiny-production Cabernet Sauvignon from two separate Howell Mountain sources. A delight in black plum, licorice and peppery leather, it's soft and complex. Boysenberry highlights the fruit components, while the finish is deftly marked by wild vanilla."
US,92,34.0,Chardonnay,Transcendence,"Pineapple, candied apple and a touch of guava jelly on toast achieve great aromatic balance on a rare Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay. The flavors are lush, not racy, and evolve in a mellow fashion, from apple to nectarine and then papaya."
Portugal,92,17.0,Castelão,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a finely perfumed wine, full of ripe Castelão grapes. It has a smooth, polished feeling from the wood aging, yet still allows plenty of room for a dense black-fruit character. It will need to age and will be best after 2016."
France,92,25.0,Riesling,Domaine Allimant-Laugner,"Soft and rich, this warm, rounded wine has concentrated fruitiness along with a more tense mineral structure. Its pink grapefruit, ripe melon and zesty lemon flavors combine to give a wine that is only just setting out. Drink from 2018."
France,92,30.0,Riesling,Domaine Charles Baur,"A truly aromatic Riesling that has a wonderful series of fruit and spice perfumes. It's ripe and full in the mouth, offering a strongly mineral edge as well as rich apple and citrus. Textured and still very tangy, the complex wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
France,92,47.0,Riesling,Domaine Ostertag,"Fronholz is from a single vineyard, a heady, perfumed wine with ripe, smooth undertones. While there is plenty of acidity, it's the opulent, ripe texture that comes right up front. A light touch of honey and melon roundness give a creamy aftertaste. Drink now, but better from 2017."
France,92,49.0,Riesling,Domaine Pfister,"This is still young, a tight wine with nervy acidity and very fresh fruitiness. A strongly mineral character from the chalk soil adds to the sense of dry, steeliness. It still needs to age, so drink from 2017."
France,92,26.0,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This concentrated wine has weight and richness while also showing a firm, very mineral and tight texture. The green fruits, aromatic red currants and tangy zest are partnered by young and exuberant freshness. It needs a few years to show its paces, so drink from 2018."
Portugal,92,53.0,Portuguese Red,Herdade Paço do Conde,"Aged for 14 months in oak, this is a rich, concentrated and dense yet smooth wine. Licorice and cassis combine, with some bitterness on the firm palate. Give it time for the tannins to mellow and harmonize a bit further; drink after 2016."
France,92,65.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château des Annereaux,"Rich while also structured, this is beginning to be delicious. Acidity comes from the black currant fruits while the structure shows dense tannins and wood-aging flavors. The wine is still young and prepared for a long haul, so don't drink before 2018."
France,92,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Labégorce Margaux,"This is the second wine of Château Labégorce. It has much of the elegance of the top wine with firm tannins and generous fruits kept in stylish proportion. Black currant and berry fruits lie under the dark, dry exterior. The wine is dense, needing several years' aging. Drink from 2018."
Italy,92,34.0,Nebbiolo,Adriano Marco & Vittorio,"This single-vineyard offering opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled soil, ripe berry, balsamic notes and a hint of leather. The palate is still young and needs time to develop fully but already delivers layers of dark cherry, licorice, grilled herb and black pepper alongside brooding tannins. Drink 2016–2026."
Italy,92,55.0,Nebbiolo,Albino Rocca,"Lovely fragrances suggest wild berry, red flower, moist earth and sweet baking spices. The palate delivers juicy black cherry layered with notes of white pepper, cinnamon and licorice supported by a tight framework of youthfully feisty tannins that need time to tame. Drink 2016–2024."
US,92,60.0,Syrah,B Cellars,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish."
US,92,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug,"This is woody, silky, and balanced between tones of tobacco leaf and herb and a swath of dark leather. It's high-toned and elegant, showcasing the softer side of Cabernet from a cool vintage, with a lengthy, memorable finish."
US,92,39.0,Cabernet Franc,Côtes de Ciel,"Just under 16% alcohol, this nonetheless displays lush and pure flavors of blueberry and black cherry, dusted with cinnamon and sandalwood. The concentration is exceptional."
Portugal,92,25.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Sagrado,"In the ownership of the Cálem family since the 19th century, Sagrado produces firmly structured wines. This dark and dense example is only just ready to drink. It is a powerful and juicy wine, full of opulent black fruits that are balanced by acidity."
US,92,42.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kiona,"This Cabernet-based blend offers lovely black cherry flavors and scents of violet, with a hint of licorice and substantial, ripe tannins on the palate. It can age for at least another 6–8 years, though it's drinking quite nicely already."
US,92,65.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Midnight,"Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos."
Chile,92,85.0,Carmenère,Montes,"As per usual, Purple Angel is a full-force experience. Hailing from a warm year, this is dense and purple in color, as it should be. Aromas of graphite, oak, tobacco and black fruit set up a jammy, full palate with saturated flavors of spice-laden blueberry and boysenberry. Finishing notes of tobacco, herb and oak cement this big-boned wine's ripe, beefy status. Drink through 2018."
US,92,43.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Anderson,"This attention-grabbing debut Chardonnay comes from a new sister winery to Roederer Estate in Mendocino County. It shows a vivid yellow-gold color, butterscotch and hazelnut aromas, butter and bosc pear flavors and tasty bread dough accents. Rich and full in flavor, it's sleek in texture, but not too full-bodied."
Portugal,92,35.0,Encruzado,Druida,"A fine,  wood-aged wine from the Dão's star white grape, it gives yellow fruit tones of apricot and peach, with toast and lees flavors providing a rich, full-bodied structure. The acidity cuts right through the palate, bringing out a lively, fresh aftertaste. Drink now, but the wine will be better in 2015."
US,92,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hess Collection,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon made in small amounts from multiple vineyards, including Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper in Oakville and the Somerston Vineyard on the eastern edges of the Napa Valley. Rich and concentrated in black plum and berry, this is a supple wine that's highlighted by a seasoning of dusty tannins and coconut shavings. The finish is awash in chocolate and cinnamon."
US,92,70.0,Chardonnay,Lynmar,"With no new oak, La Sereinité is indeed serene, textured and round with vibrant acidity. The aromatics do the talking first, inviting one in with nuanced white peach, orange blossom and lime before the palate develops over time into richer, fuller flavors of crème brûlée. Throughout, the wine is balanced and expressive."
US,92,80.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prim Family,"Fresh, brambly raspberry and cherry open this wine that's structured in firm tannins and ripe, lingering layers of tobacco and clove. The Cabernet is blended with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. This one is enjoyable now, with a long and clean finish, but it will also cellar well through 2022."
Portugal,92,25.0,Portuguese Red,Quanta Terra,"A fine blend of the classic Douro grapes gives a complex and dark wine that's firm in tannin but also offers ample fruity richness. The wood aging has started the process of smoothing the tannins, working towards a ripe, full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016."
Italy,92,65.0,Nebbiolo,Castello di Neive,"From one of the most celebrated vineyards in Barbaresco, this structured wine offers aromas of mature black fruit accented with whiffs of balsamic herbs and new leather. The palate delivers crushed black cherry and rasberry layered with notes of black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside assertive tannins. It needs time to unfold and develop. Drink 2016–2026."
France,92,65.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château des Annereaux,"This starts out smooth and rounded and then begins to develop a drier, firmer character. Putting the flattering richness and the structure together and the wine is both rich and solid, with black currant fruits vying with a dry core. It still needs time; drink from 2017."
Portugal,85,15.0,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Falua,"This warm, ripe wine is open and ready to drink. With its bold red fruit and generous, well-integrated tannins, it's made for barbecues. Drink now."
South Africa,85,10.0,Chardonnay,Robertson Winery,"A lovely flinty character graces the yellow apple, peach and orange cream aromas on the nose of this friendly wine. It's quite round and mouthfilling, with a prevailing smoky flavor on the palate that's reminiscent of baked apple with bacon crumble. Drink now."
South Africa,85,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Neil Ellis,"A very pale, watery straw color, this is soft and low in intensity, with faint aromas and flavors of citrus pith and fresh grass. The palate is thin and light, followed by a short, brisk finish. Drink now."
France,85,63.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Domaine du Pegau,"Like the hyperexpensive Cuvée à Tempo, Pegau's 2015 Cuvée Reservée has a slightly bitter edge to the finish. Otherwise, it shows subtle pineapple, anise and white gumdrop notes and medium body."
Argentina,85,35.0,Malbec,Antonio Gonzalez,"Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy, with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry, while the finish feels sticky, tannic and heavy."
South Africa,85,10.0,Chenin Blanc,KWV,"Scents of green apple and plum lead the bouquet, with a strong lime-pith note that carries through to the palate. The texture is soft and somewhat flat on the midpalate, but ample acidity and a pleasant astringency help to lift the close. Drink now."
US,85,32.0,Sangiovese,Benessere,"Reduced on the nose, this wine has a nuttiness and a petrol-like quality that colors its otherwise thin dried plum flavor. Low in oak, it will pair well with traditional Italian fare."
France,85,,Chardonnay,Blason de Bourgogne,"This is a crisp, lightly perfumed wine with attractive apple acidity and touches of grapefruit. The texture is soft, with a bright aftertaste. Drink now."
US,85,18.0,Chardonnay,Alexander Valley Vineyards,"This widely available white is unfussy and medium bodied, with toasted oak and baked apple flavors, brightened by a squeeze of lemon."
France,85,11.0,Colombard-Sauvignon Blanc,Georges Vigouroux,"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now."
France,85,9.0,Malbec-Merlot,Georges Vigouroux,This is an easygoing fruity wine. It has soft tannins and bright juicy red fruits. The structure is just right to give the wine its shape along with the acidity and generous aftertaste. Drink now.
France,85,12.0,Malbec,Georges Vigouroux,"This is one of several wines from this producer that are created to give lie to the tannic Malbec. This is soft, ripe and full of the young fruitiness that demands to be drunk now."
US,85,18.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Martinez & Martinez,"This wine starts out a bit reduced, along with aromas of melon and red apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with a blend of stone-fruit and tropical flavors."
US,85,52.0,Zinfandel,Mazzocco,"Blended with less than a handful of Petite Sirah, this wine is thick and ultraripe, showing dense chocolate and plum sauce flavors, accented with soy."
Portugal,85,15.0,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Casal Branco,"A soft and ripe wine with spicy red fruit flavors cushioned by a smooth texture, this has well-embedded tannins and can be drunk young."
Portugal,85,15.0,Portuguese White,Quinta do Casal Monteiro,"Soft and smooth, this is a ripe and creamy wine. It has light acidity, pineapple and apricot flavors and a rounded aftertaste. Drink now."
US,85,27.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Schooler Nolan,"Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish."
Spain,85,30.0,Moscatel,Ochoa,"Pine notes and an aroma akin to floor polish make for an iffy start. This carries a slight chemical flavor as it moves along, while honey and brown-sugar notes sweeten things up. A chunky, obtuse finish feels sticky due to mild acidity."
US,85,15.0,Chardonnay,Treleaven,Hints of nut and spice on the nose lift flatter tones of pressed apple and pear in the palate of this medium-bodied white. Soft lemonade acidity brightens the finish.
Argentina,85,13.0,Malbec,Laberinto,"Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut."
France,85,13.0,Marsanne,Cave de Tain,"Round and pillowy in feel, this is a simple wine, offering modest melon and pineapple fruit. Drink it over the next few months."
US,85,25.0,Red Blend,Hudson-Chatham,"A highly unusual blend of Burdin, a rare French hybrid, and Chambourcin grapes, this red wine offers delicate maraschino-cherry and berry flavors. It's a slightly fragile wine but whiffs of tobacco and garden soil lend complexity. The finish lingers on tart red fruit flavors and a hint of tannin."
France,85,17.0,Malbec,Château Armandière,"The 12 months of wood aging has left its mark on this wine, giving it a spicy burnt character. That makes it tough and unlikely to broaden out. It will likely remain dry and firm."
Portugal,85,10.0,Portuguese Red,Casa Santa Vitória,"Made to be drunk young, this wine gives a burst of ripe red fruit. The tannins are soft and open, balanced with acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and generous. Drink now."
Portugal,85,7.0,Portuguese White,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,"Named for the Servite convent in the town of Borba, this fresh, crisp and tangy wine is citric, with almond and apple overtones. It's young, fruity and made for immediate consumption."
Portugal,85,14.0,Portuguese Red,Alves de Sousa,"A typical Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca, this wine is all about bright, crisp fruit. Black and red currant flavors come with tight acidity and a juicy character. Tightly wound now, it needs a few more months to calm down. Drink from 2018."
Italy,85,10.0,White Blend,Amatore,"A blend of Chardonnay, Garganega and Sauvignon, this has aromas of peach and golden apple. The simple palate offers pineapple and banana alongside bright acidity. Enjoy soon."
France,85,9.0,White Blend,Georges Vigouroux,"An intriguing blend of grapes with both Bordeaux and Gaillac origins has produced a wine that has a softly herbal character as well as richer white stone fruits and an attractive perfume. It is a pretty wine, ready to drink and very fruity."
Portugal,85,10.0,Siria,Companhia das Quintas,"According to legend, the Baron of Figuiera got his foot stuck in the stirrup while riding one day. He promised that where his horse stopped, he would build a chapel, and that's where this 2,100 foot high, cool-climate vineyard is today. The wine is crisp and fresh, with attractive citrus notes and plenty of refreshing acidity. Drink now."
US,85,20.0,Chardonnay,Decoy,"A large production offering, this white is simple and direct in its expression of the variety, remaining steely and low in oak on the palate, with a depth of green apple and melon fruit."
US,87,25.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Lafayette Reneau,"Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish."
France,87,35.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lalaudey,"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mancèdre,"This firm and dry wine is also full of acidity. A juicy start is then given a firm jolt by the tannins, but the complex structure allows plenty of room for the bright fruits. Drink from 2018."
France,87,20.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Peyfaures,"Fresh and juicy, this full-bodied while structured wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, which gives the fruitiness and blackberry fruit flavors. It will develop quickly and can be drunk from 2016."
US,87,23.0,Syrah,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards,"This moderately aromatic wine conveys Red Hots, baking spices and red fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft yet full of drawn-out blue-fruit flavors on the finish."
US,87,24.0,Riesling,Balo,"With aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple skin, peach skin, white pepper and pomegranate seed, this tastes crisp, tangy, slightly bitter, and has great bright acidity. It is light to medium bodied and made from 100% whole-cluster-pressed Riesling that was fermented in a combination of older oak barrels and stainless steel vessels."
US,87,16.0,Chardonnay,Byron,"Toffee, cinnamon apples and a hefty swirl of smoke arise on the nose from the winery's entry-level bottling. The palate shows caramelized pears, nicely bitter lemon rinds and warm, buttered nut toffee note that carries from first sip to the finish."
US,87,32.0,Merlot,Burnt Bridge,"Blended with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers notes of herbs, ground cranberries and woodspice. Flavors are jammy with an astringent squeeze to the tannins."
Italy,87,55.0,Sangiovese,Camigliano,"Aromas of underbrush, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor carry over to the palate, along with dried cherry and licorice. Astringent tannins provide support."

Italy,87,42.0,Red Blend,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"Aromas of dark berry, clove, bell pepper and cedar take shape in the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, oak and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need time, the fruit is already starting to dry up."
US,87,74.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Mountain,"Barrel tones of coconut and woodspice take the lead in front of cranberry and blackberry, with the fruit seeming a bit dried out. It's reserved in style but still fully flavored with sour cherries accented by licorice."
Spain,87,15.0,Monastrell,Finca Hispana,"Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness."
US,87,35.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gård,"This wine offers dark coffee, green olive, savory notes and barrel spices. The flavors are lighter in style but with good concentration backed by firm, lipsmacking tannins."
US,87,20.0,Cabernet Franc,Millbrook,"Bramble wood and savory herbs lend earthiness to this ripe, juicy wine. Fruit-forward in style, the palate bursts with black currants and cherry flavors. Soft acidity and a whisper of tannins on the finish keep the mouthfeel plush."
Argentina,87,11.0,Malbec,Rutini,"This friendly wine offers fresh, jammy berry and cherry aromas. The palate has a bit of grit and stickiness to it, while blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry flavors are ripe, sweet, not pushy and ultimately satisfying."
Argentina,87,38.0,Malbec,Sur de los Andes,"Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat."
Argentina,87,18.0,Pinot Noir,Trapiche,"Floral berry, earth and tea aromas are friendly. This Pinot is fresh and perky in feel, with red-fruit and tomato-like acidity pushing flavors of dry cherry, mixed spices, herbs and tomato. This finishes spunky, with crisp acidity and peppery overtones."
Italy,87,75.0,Red Blend,Donne Fittipaldi,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, black pepper, graphite and espresso alongside dusty tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate."
Spain,87,10.0,Garnacha Blanca,Finca Hispana,"Neutral on the nose except for a whiff of apple, this is a wine to drink now. A round, pulpy palate is balanced by citric acidity, while waxy flavors of baked apple and peach finish briny and round, with a hint of green banana."
US,87,18.0,Riesling,Hat Ranch,"Moderately aromatic, this recalls lime leaf and mineral. It drinks off dry with tangerine and other citrus flavors."
Italy,87,40.0,Red Blend,Aia Vecchia,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this conveys aromas of vanilla, oak, red currant and cedar. The hearty palate displays mature plum, dried cherry, espresso and bell pepper alongside drying tannins. It finishes with the heat of alcohol."
France,87,30.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château du Cartillon,"Ripe and fruity, this is packed with black currant juiciness supported by a strong tannic element. Vineyards close to the Gironde estuary give this property a fine location. The smokiness of the wood combines with bright acidity at the end."
France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand Billard,"Firm and dense, this is a wine with a good future. Its blackberry fruits, smoky dry tannins and touches of wood aging are joined with acidity to bring out a structured character. Drink from 2016."
France,87,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Laffitte Carcasset,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
France,87,13.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Maine d'Arman,"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine."
France,87,19.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Noaillac,"While the wood aging of this wine still shows, it's already balancing out with the ripe black fruits and rich structure. An attractive smoky character is followed by juicy berry flavors and acidity. This is a wine to age, so wait until 2017."
France,87,25.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Saransot-Dupré,"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017."
US,87,21.0,Zinfandel,Chacewater,"Big in flavor and ripeness, this full-bodied wine tastes concentrated and feels lush, almost soft. It smells like boysenberry jam, tastes like dried cherries and dried plums and has a streak of raspberry that lifts it a bit."
US,87,18.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Billsboro,"Crushed rocks and smoke mingle with savory dried herb and bramble in this lean, dry wine. Lemon-lime acidity reverberates against a core of fresh pear flavor. The finish is tight and brisk."
Spain,89,34.0,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo,"Potent black-plum and black-cherry aromas come with a ton of grainy, spicy oak. This is both fresh and bright as well as dark, brawny and roasted in character. Flavors of ripe blackberry and cherry share the stage with toasty, charred oak and spice flavors in front of an aggressive but tasty finish."
Italy,89,32.0,Red Blend,Amantis,"This savory blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Alicante and a dollop of Petit Verdot and Colorino delivers core flavors of crushed plum and ripe blackberry, accented with notes of white pepper, clove and dried herbs. It's easy drinking and balanced, with fine-grained tannins."
US,89,33.0,Chardonnay,Anam Cara,"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish."
France,89,22.0,Red Blend,Cave du Marmandais,"Produced from a selection of small parcels, this perfumed wood-aged wine is big and concentrated while also keeping style and balance. It is dark, firm in the center with tannins that are surrounded by juicy acidity and black currant fruits. Keep for a few more months and drink from 2016."
Portugal,89,12.0,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"A jammy, ripe wine that's deliciously full of plum jelly flavors. The dry, dusty tannins are in the background enhancing the structure although still leaving the rich fruit and wood flavors at the front. Drink this full-bodied wine from 2017."
France,89,26.0,Malbec,Château de Cénac,"This is a ripe, perfumed wine with smooth, generous texture and broad black fruits. An earthy, leathery edge gives extra character, and the suggestion of maturity comes from the wood aging and the ripe berry fruits. Drink now."
US,89,22.0,Pinot Noir,Deer Creek,"This Rogue Valley Pinot is markedly different from more familiar Willamette Valley styles. Though not at all fleshy, it has pretty, sculpted strawberry and raspberry fruit, lightly candied and fully ripened. A wash of butterscotch wraps around the pleasing finish."
France,89,13.0,Red Blend,Domaine Roumagnac,"Made from the oldest vines on the estate, this ripe and fruity wine is ready to drink. Its tannins are already integrated, leaving a smooth-textured wine that is accompanied by spice and red plum fruit flavors."
Germany,89,45.0,Riesling,Richard Böcking,"Puckering lime zest and lemon notes are softened by crisp yellow peach and nectarine in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. Racy and brisk, it finishes with an elegant crush of minerals. Drink now."
Spain,88,25.0,Red Blend,Mas Igneus,"On the nose, this is challenging: gaseous, oaky aromas of wet cement also contain notes of bitter lettuce, baking spices and general grit. Raw, tannic and abrasive on the palate, this unfolds to offer herbal flavors of berry and plum. Tannic, scratchy, rugged and mildly green on the finish."
Spain,88,22.0,Red Blend,Clos de Tafall,"Muscular, leathery aromas of dark-berry fruits come with a can't-miss animal element. This Grenache-Carignan blend features a powerful grip and grabby texture. Earthy, jammy flavors of raspberry and plum end with herbal accents, dry spice and the taste of bitter black cherry."
Greece,88,19.0,Agiorgitiko,Palivou,"Savory meat and vanilla on the nose lead into flavors of cherry, pepper and plum in this well-made, balanced red. Fresh but fruity, the wine has a wave of warming spice and a clean finish that will pair well with grilled meats, salmon and cheeses."
US,88,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Foursight,"This is a light-tasting, dry wine with white pepper and fennel aromas, crisp green apple and lemon flavors, and a savory, earthy nuance that adds complexity. Medium bodied and mouth-filling, this interesting wine steps outside the flavor box."
US,88,96.0,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Keenan,"This blend of half Merlot, half Cabernet Sauvignon is rustically earthy and soft, betraying the plush, plummy Merlot. Tight on the finish and medium in weight, it has a black peppery finish that appeals and suggests pairing with well-seasoned meats."
France,88,,Gros and Petit Manseng,Domaine Nigri,"While this wine has an attractive honey character, it is only lightly sweet. It's more about acidity balanced with richness and a wonderful orange-zest character that gives a lift as well as bright aftertaste. The wine needs until 2016 to get its full act together."
US,88,28.0,Red Blend,Coup de Grace,"This has a very deep red color, spicy aromas like cedar, vanilla and cocoa, and rich, chocolaty, berrylike flavors. While quite full bodied, it's as smooth as velvet due to moderate tannins and soft acidity."
US,88,19.0,Pinot Noir,Saint Gregory,"The color is not too deep or too light, showing a red-brick rim. Aromas resemble red cherry and cranberry, while fresh, tart and tangy flavors like cranberry and raspberry combine with firm tannins for a bit of grip in the texture. Lean and medium bodied, it will make a versatile foil for food."
US,88,26.0,Mourvèdre,Longevity,"This intriguing wine reflects the typical wild and earthy characteristics of the grape variety. It has smoky, earthy raspberry aromas, plum and pomegranate flavors, a touch of tartness, a smooth texture and medium body. It tastes mature and mellow."
Italy,88,17.0,Red Blend,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"Here's a savory, easygoing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah that opens with aromas of red berry and cooking spice. The fresh palate offers black cherries, crushed strawberries, white pepper and a hint of clove alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink now."
Italy,88,35.0,Red Blend,Nera,"A blend of 80% Nebbiolo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon aged in barriques, this opens with aromas of bell pepper, cedar and red currant. The palate delivers dried black cherries, coffee, mocha and grilled herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Portugal,88,20.0,Port,Delaforce,"From one of the great names of Port, this LBV is a richly sweet wine, full of dried fruits, balanced acidity and a soft, smooth texture. It is a generous, very accessible wine."
France,88,18.0,Malbec,Clos Troteligotte,"Made from a series of small parcels, this fruity wine shows the fresh side of Malbec. With its gushing purple color and ripe black-plum juice flavors, it's designed to drink young. Try it from 2016."
US,88,34.0,Pinot Noir,Et Fille,"A barrel-selection from multiple vineyard sources, this offers black cherry fruit highlighted by root beer and black licorice. Aging nine months in 25% new barrels adds pleasant toastiness to the finish."
US,88,14.0,Meritage,Falkner,"Bordeaux blends show promise in this region. This combination of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37.5% Merlot and 12.5% Cabernet Franc reveals rustic, leathery aromas of crushed Italian herbs, dried red cherries and fresh dill. Once sipped, flavors of fresh-ground coffee, oregano and bay leaf spice a base of cranberry fruit."
US,88,28.0,Rosé,HammerSky,"There's a respectably complex nose on this pink wine, with lemonade and pressed plums blending into a wet cement minerality. The palate is very tasty, with flavors of pomegranate, dried rose petals, hibiscus, night jasmine and even a clove-laced mocha element proving quite intriguing."
US,88,66.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,HdV,"Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick."
US,88,25.0,Grenache,Donati,"Rose petals, violets, red cherries, plums, rhubarb and heavily peppered spices dominate the nose of this tasty wine from a little-known appellation 27 miles inland from Monterey Bay. It's softly textured upon sipping, then acidity shows up and holds through the sip, along with a stemmy tension. Fresh flavors include sour cherries and red berries."
US,88,28.0,Zinfandel,Eberle,"The grapes for this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle are nearly equally sourced from three vineyards: Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and CoCaVin. The nose is herbal with sagebrush, oregano and thyme, offering just a bit of black plum fruit. The palate is also full of crushed, dried herbs, proving a touch sour and tarry, with cooked strawberry and dried raspberry fruit."
US,88,28.0,Riesling,Hyland,"Sourced from vines planted in the 1980s, this tart and steely wine mixes lemongrass and citrus flavors with hints of riper peach. It finishes with suggestions of fresh-brewed tea."
Chile,88,13.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Indomita,"Lean aromas of bell pepper and green fruits are not overly intense. This is linear, juicy and tight in frame. Flavors of lime, scallion, caper and dry cider finish racy and scouring. Good mouthfeel is a plus."
France,91,,Tannat,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"There is nothing bashful about this wine. It's big, bold and structured. It holds the potential of great fruitiness as well, a solid core that is surrounded by ripe black berries, just a touch of chocolate and wood. Drink from 2017."
US,91,24.0,Primitivo,Macchia,"Intensely aromatic in spicy black cherry and earthy leather, the Devious Primitivo is more structured than some of Macchia's Zinfandels, more savory than sweet, with tannic grip. Smooth and velvety, it'll impress alongside salumi and other charcuterie."
Italy,91,25.0,Turbiana,Le Morette,"It opens with fragrances of stone fruit, Granny Smith apple and white almonds. The succulent palate delivers juicy pear, white peach, nutmeg, white almond and mineral alongside crisp acidity. It's nicely balanced with great length and finesse."
US,91,36.0,Syrah,Margerum,"Made from grapes grown in one of the best vineyards in the valley, this Syrah is a particular success, given the challenging vintage. It's tannic, bone dry and zesty in acidity, with deeply extracted blackberry, black currant, charred meat bone and black pepper flavors. The long, rich finish suggests aging. Hold until 2017."
Germany,91,18.0,Riesling,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,"Smoke accents ripe yellow peaches on the nose of this intensely penetrating kabinett. The palate shocks with luscious mango and melon flavors, layered with bristling mineral accents. It finishes long, with a reverberating astringency."
Chile,91,23.0,Syrah,Polkura,"Rich and complex, it unfolds with aromas of graphite, barrel smoke, cured meat and berry fruits that settle on a smooth palate with layering and plush tannins. Bright flavors of blackberry, chocolate and cappuccino finish lightly herbal, with a tobacco note and zero heaviness. Drink through 2018."
US,91,28.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Cowhorn,"This compelling blend of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne—aged for three months in 20% new French oak—brings notes of barrel spices, apricot and pear. There's a touch of sweetness to the full -bodied, textured fruit flavors that provides a perfect counterbalance to the sharply defined, lingering finish."
Portugal,91,40.0,Arinto,Dão Sul,"Initially this wine is smooth and creamy textured. As it opens up it shows a cool, crisp character, with white apple fruits and layers of spice from wood aging. It's an elegant wine, very balanced already, but likely to age for several years. Drink now and until 2020."
France,91,78.0,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"Rich and full in the mouth, this is a wine with structure, tight minera ltexture and beautifully juicy fruit. The acidity is a strong part of this wine, giving a citrus tang to go over the wood aging. Drink from 2016."
US,91,43.0,Zinfandel,Dutcher Crossing,"There's nothing shy about this Zin, which showcases both the variety's personality and the wine's terroir. The raspberry, licorice and espresso flavors have a sweet edge of brown sugar. The finish is entirely dry but hot, but that's part of Dry Creek's charm, and suggests pairing with rich, spicy, smoky meats."
France,91,65.0,Pinot Noir,Evening Land,"An intense and fresh wine that is packed with acidity as well as powerful red fruits. It is breathtakingly fruity at this stage, the structure still developing and giving a delicious perfumed berry character. Drink from 2015."
US,91,44.0,Chardonnay,Failla,"Lots of purity, with acidity and stony minerality providing earthy balance to the lemon, lime and mango fruit flavors. Thoroughly dry, it's a classy wine to drink now."
US,91,50.0,Pinot Noir,Flowers,"This beautiful Pinot Noir is a blend of various vineyards throughout the appellation. It shows classic coastal acidity, dryness and silkiness, with appealing raspberry, red licorice, cola and pomegranate flavors, wrapped into finely ground tannins. Decant and drink now."
US,91,56.0,Pinot Noir,Benovia,"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017."
France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cheval Blanc,"The second wine of Château Cheval Blanc is packed with wood flavors and spice. A toasty wine, it also has solid tannins plus fragrant fruitiness. Already the fruit is coming through strongly and it is for medium-term aging. Drink from 2017."
France,91,30.0,Viognier,Château Lagrézette,"Made from Viognier grown in the Gaillac region, this is a rich wine with tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wood aging shows gently through the fresh fruit and attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, but will improve until 2018."
France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Les Trois Manoirs,"This full-throated wine has layers of black fruits, firm tannins and a dense texture. It is rich, the black plum fruits partnered by dark chocolate and licorice. Wood aging still shows and the wine needs to broaden out even more as it ages. Drink from 2018."
France,91,22.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mauvesin Barton,"This marks the first vintage of this Moulis estate under the ownership of the Barton family of Léoville Barton. Already the wine is showing breeding and an understated structure and richness. Lightly perfumed, full of black fruits and integrated tannins, it should age well. Drink from 2017."
US,91,48.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Amapola Creek,"Syrah dominates the blend on this dry, complex red wine. It brings tannins and deep flavors of blackberries and charred meat. One-third of Grenache adds lightness and cherries, while oak contributes the perfect note of toast. The alcohol is high, but it never feels hot, just mouth-filling and warming. It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak."
Portugal,91,22.0,Portuguese Red,Dão Sul,"Tannins give a dark, mineral structure. The black fruits, slowly coming through, are still part of this serious purpose, with wood flavors and dry fruits prominent. It still needs aging, so don't drink before 2016."
France,91,60.0,Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene,"Because strong toast aromas show through this wine, its attractive full fruit will need time to come through. The wine, with its firm, almost red-wine structure, needs to age until 2016 before drinking."
France,91,40.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine D'en Ségur,"This is a powerful, rich blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has structure, dark tannins, complex red berry fruits and just the right amount of wood aging. With its solid structured foundation that is partnered with the ripe fruits, it's going to age well. Drink from 2016."
France,91,,Petit Manseng,Domaine Nigri,"This apricot and honey flavored wine is both rich and fresh. The balance between the sweetness, the botrytis and the acidity is just right. It will go well with blue cheese or pâté. Drink from 2015."
US,91,19.0,Riesling,Elk Cove,"Bone dry, this succulent, citrus-soaked Riesling is a textural marvel. Mixing grapefruit, lime and pear fruit flavors, its racy acidity underscores its complexity."
Portugal,91,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Rocim,"Named after a 17th-century nun who lived nearby, this wine packs impressive power and concentration. A great weight of solid tannins are paired with luscious red fruits. Its density, dry core and layers of fruit and acidity promise good aging. Drink from 2017."
US,91,64.0,Chardonnay,Jarvis,"This wine is made in the style of the winery's marvelous Finch Hollow Chardonnays, but is just a little less concentrated. Dry, crisp and elegantly clean, it has complex, mineral-infused flavors of tangerines, peaches and limes, enhanced with lots of smoky new oak. It should hold in the bottle through 2016."
France,91,74.0,Pinot Noir,Roche de Bellene,"Showing richness, this wine is smooth and well balanced between ripe red berry fruits and generous tannins. The wood aging shows in a slight burnt edge, but this will pass as the wine develops. Drink from 2016."
Italy,91,24.0,Turbiana,Ca' Lojera,"This rich, youthful wine is another example of Lugana that is aging gracefully and has more to give. It opens with aromas of citrus, dried apricots and flint that carry over to the palate together with lemon drop, grapefruit and pear, plus fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the start of the long finish. Drink now through 2018."
Portugal,91,,Loureiro,Casal Paço Padreiro,"Some wood aging has rounded out this fruity wine. But it has not radically changed its inherent fresh, crisp character. It shows apples, lemon and lime juice and just a touch of spice from wood. The wine is ready to drink but will be best if left until 2015."
Portugal,91,,Portuguese Red,Caves Velhas,"Still firmly tannic, this wine is densely structured and shows good potential. It has dark tannins and rich berry fruits, followed by a more juicy aftertaste. With power and style combining well, it should be aged. Drink from 2017."
US,88,63.0,Pinot Noir,Testarossa,"With a licorice, chemise and cherry-laden nose reminiscent of a hillside hike through the chaparral in the morning dew, this wine is rather tannic on entry, tending toward chamomile tea with cranberry fruit. With a strong tannic backbone, it could drink well for awhile."
Spain,88,14.0,Tempranillo,Viña Albali,"Raw, lightly leafy red-berry aromas properly announce what amounts to a juicy, snappy Tempranillo with berry, spice and dry oak flavors. A dry feeling, peppery tasting finish is traditional for good, basic Spanish table wine."
US,88,16.0,Pinot Gris,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"All stainless fermented, this seems to show some residual sugar, perhaps in order to round out the austere acidity. Lemon and tangerine fruit—all with plenty of acid—are annotated with highlights of fresh cilantro. It would be a fine match for simple, white fish."
Argentina,88,21.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso,"Candied red-berry aromas are pasty at first, with a twinge of green. In the mouth, this is wiry and jammy feeling, with juicy acids. Herbal, slightly green flavors of olive, toast and berry fruits finish minty and a bit hot."
France,88,15.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Prince de Tabourg,"Tight, nervy and mineral, this crisp and fruity wine needs a few months to develop fully. It's lively with citrus fruits, an herbaceous character and steely aftertaste."
US,88,18.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pull,"Blackberry liqueur, violet, cola and slight dustiness form the nose of this well-priced wine. The flavors are a bit thinner than expected, most reminiscent of ripe pomegranate."
Italy,88,50.0,Nebbiolo,Rattalino,"Pretty aromas suggest plum, red berry, leather, graphite and eucalyptus. The understated palate isn't as expressive as the nose, but reveals subdued black cherry, black pepper, espresso and oak. Astringent tannins still need to integrate, but for now leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2020."
US,88,18.0,Pinot Noir,Red Pony Ranch,"The Red Pony brand is putting out reliably distinct wines. This one smells of cranberry, oregano and barnyard. The tannins and acidity are solid, with strawberry and pomegranate flavors leading to an earthy finish. Hold until 2016 for an even smoother time."
Italy,88,80.0,Nebbiolo,Andrea Oberto,"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and a hint of tire rubber. The palate displays sweet black cherry extract layered with milk chocolate, coffee and oak alongside bracing tannins and racy acidity. Drink after 2018."
US,88,48.0,Pinot Noir,Dominio IV,"The lightest wine in the winery's well-crafted lineup, this marries grapefruity acidity to tart cherry fruit. It's nicely balanced, airy and a pleasure to drink."
France,88,22.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Dominique Pabiot,"This tight, young wine is shot through with steely acidity and minerality. It tastes of the flinty soil of Pouilly, full in the mouth and concentrated. Give it until 2015 before drinking."
US,88,16.0,Pinot Noir,Elk Cove,"Crafted entirely from estate-grown fruit, this tart, citrus-flavored rosé is anchored in rhubarb and strawberry flavors. It offers medium concentration and length, with a subtle suggestion of cola woven into the finish."
Argentina,88,28.0,Malbec,Finca La Luz,"Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing. This is raisiny and ripe in feel, with a complex mix of berry, fennel and anise flavors. A lush, dense-feeling finish is minty and herbal."
US,88,35.0,Pinot Noir,Foppiano,"This tastes of warmer Russian River Valley climes, darker and riper in black cherry and berry fruit character with a layering of toasty cinnamon and oak. The aroma tends to the earthy/pastoral."
US,88,40.0,Pinot Noir,Kramer,"As is often the case with Oregon's 2011 Pinots, this remains stubbornly tight, and shows herbal and stem flavors rather than pretty fruit. That said, it also displays the excellent structure of the better wines from the vintage. Underpinnings of acid and tannin, plus the still sharp-edged pomegranate fruit, may carry it up to 2024."
US,88,48.0,Pinot Noir,Le Cadeau,"This comes from estate-grown fruit in the Chehalem Mountains AVA. Spicy and sharp-toned, it brings tart acidity and highlights of orange peel to flavors of wild mountain berries. The tannins are still a bit rough, but should smooth out with more bottle age."
France,88,12.0,Melon,Les Vignerons des Terroirs de la Noëlle,"It's the hard, granite rock of the vineyards that gives this wine its tight, firm texture. It is very crisp, structured with tense acidity and strong lemon-lime flavors. The wine, with its intense freshness, is very much made to partner food."
US,88,20.0,Pinot Gris,MacMurray Estate Vineyards,"A new label for MacMurray Ranch, this Pinot Gris is stony in fresh nectarine, pear and mango, wrapped in a creamy texture that develops fleshy flavors of fig in the glass. The fruit is sourced from both MacMurray Ranch and Gallo's cooler Russian River Valley outpost, Two Rock, near Petaluma."
US,88,26.0,Petite Sirah,Miro,"This wine offers a lighter side of Petite Sirah. It conveys more red fruit than brooding black and blue, a taste of red licorice and lean, balanced red cherries sleekly layered over earthy plum and spice. Its structure and acidity make it food-friendly, ready to accent a black pepper steak or similarly seasoned roast."
Italy,88,55.0,Nebbiolo,Ca' del Baio,"Exotic incense, sandalwood and ripe berry aromas waft from the glass of this single-vineyard Barbaresco. The palate is initially closed but slowly reveals crunchy Morello cherry, toast and espresso alongside assertive tannins. Drink after 2018."
Spain,88,8.0,Grenache-Syrah,Los Dos,"Pure berry aromas define the nose on this highly drinkable Garnacha-Syrah blend. In the mouth, it's clean, juicy, a bit round and easy to process. Typical Aragónese flavors of plum and berry finish tasty and unbroken."
Spain,88,16.0,Mencía,Luna Beberide,"This respected Bierzo producer's base-level Mencía is jumpy on the nose, with floral berry and plum aromas. It feels fresh and bright, with ample structure. Standard berry, plum and currant flavors come with notes of spice, while the finish is forward and fresh."
US,88,30.0,Viognier,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,"Floral and pretty in ripe peach and pineapple/mango, it unwinds with a finish of vanilla."
US,88,23.0,Pinot Gris,Maysara,"Finished (apparently) off-dry, this seems to show some residual sugar in a leesy, yeasty style. The fruit suggests pears and cotton candy, with juicy acidity supporting the sweetness. Don't look for your standard dry Pinot Gris, but what's here is generous and enjoyable."
US,88,21.0,Red Blend,MCV,"This Petite Sirah-led blend offers cherry, cedar and smoke, with a bit of morel mushroom funk on the nose. The palate reveals tobacco, plum jam and harder-than-expected tannins, with a slight vanilla finish."
US,88,30.0,Pinot Noir,Navarro,"This is a smooth, easy-drinking and rather light-bodied wine, not unusual in the tricky vintage of 2011. Relatively light in color, this offers scents of sweet cherry, vanilla and cinnamon, while the flavors recall cherry and raspberry. The texture is almost delicate but livened up with a good touch of acidity."
Spain,88,30.0,Moscatel,Ochoa,"Varietally specific aromas of wild flowers, honey and lemon verbena set up an unctuous, creamy palate with modest acidity and lots of weight. Honey, mango, vanilla and other sweet, tropical flavors finish thick but not quite cloying. This is a unique wine for Navarra that deserves to be judged on its own."
Italy,88,35.0,Nebbiolo,Reverdito,"Plum, vanilla, chocolate and subtle oak aromas carry over to the palate. The palate displays chocolate-covered cherries, fig and coffee alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2018–2025."
US,88,17.0,Pinot Gris,Silvan Ridge,"This is aggressively tart and herbal, but shows good density and concentration. Flavors of lemon verbena mixed with lime-ade run true and full on through an extended, focused finish."
US,88,25.0,Pinot Noir,Stemmler,"Pastoral and earthy, it's straightforward and tightly woven in tannins, with balanced acidity that offers a sense of wild strawberries. A well-made wine priced attractively; stock up for midweek needs."
Italy,90,24.0,Carricante,Cottanera,"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish."
US,90,40.0,Pinot Noir,Carabella,"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer."
Hungary,90,16.0,White Blend,Chateau Dereszla,"This delicate Hungarian white wine is a blend of 86% Furmint, 9% Yellow Muscat and 5% Kabar. It has enticing aromas of white flowers, botrytis, gardenia, apple blossom and apricot that prepare your palate for flavors of peach juice, citrus zest, grapefruit juice, caramelized pineapple and a crisp clean finish."
US,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Easton,"In a classic combination of ripe flavors and lip-smacking structure, this full-bodied wine wraps concentrated black cherry and mint aromas and generous cherry and blackberry flavors in muscular tannins that keep the texture fresh."
US,90,28.0,Syrah,Fess Parker,"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate."
Italy,90,21.0,Fiano,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close."
US,90,36.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Andrew Murray,"The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar."
Greece,90,28.0,Assyrtiko,Argyros,"Pineapple and lime peel start the nose of this layered Assyrtiko. On the palate, it unfolds with a combination of lemon peel, grapefruit and sea salt. This wine can age for several years but is good to drink now; pair with lamb, fresh fish or Asian cuisine."
US,90,65.0,Zinfandel,Lorenzi Estate,"Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip."
US,90,49.0,Pinot Noir,MacPhail,"Huckleberry and dark cherry mingle around a viscosity of velvety texture and tannin, dusted in notions of black tea, tar and red currant. Light in color, but bold in flavor, this wine speaks to both the cool nature of its vineyard site, and to the style of the winemaker."
US,90,44.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog,"Smooth, medium-bodied layers of pomegranate, red currant and a refreshing sense of citrus make for a light, food friendly companion, especially with the wine's satisfying bite of acidity and lengthy finish."
US,90,48.0,Zinfandel,Hunnicutt,The grapes for this full-bodied wine hail from the Luvisi Vineyard in the heart of Calistoga old-vine country—a warm and welcome site for the variety. Baked blackberry and black olive combine around a taste of charred meat before brawny spins of brown sugar and nutmeg play on the palate with jolts of chocolate and vanilla.
US,90,28.0,Chardonnay,J Vineyards & Winery,"This is a creamy, thick and food friendly white with highlights of honey and green apple and a lingering decadence of ginger, just hinting at anise. Medium-bodied, it represents the vintage and the appellation well, at a price that's nice."
US,90,30.0,Rosé,Kale,"A majority of Grenache and tiny bit of Mourvèdre from Kick Ranch and McGah Vineyard were racked to concrete egg for fermentation, with the intent of preserving freshness. Successful in that quest, this orange-pink wine is dry, tangy and well-integrated in terms of acidity, subtle in cranberry, dried cherry and orange, with a light, refreshing finish."
France,90,17.0,Sylvaner,Leon Beyer,"The slightest notes of angelica and kiwi fruit lend perfume to a slender, almost weightless body. This slinky Sylvaner runs rings around you, intriguing with its weightless charm. It's dry, lithe and refreshing."
Italy,90,39.0,Red Blend,Tornatore,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, fennel, toast and baking spice come together in the glass. The taut, focused, palate shows ripe black cherry, red raspberry, mineral and licorice while fresh acidity and firm tannins provide balance. Drink 2019 through 2024."
US,90,16.0,Grenache,Upper Five,"Spicy and lightly peppery, this fresh rosé brings concentrated strawberry fruit into focus. Made from organically grown grapes, it expands into a full-bodied finish with a lick of milk chocolate."
Germany,90,22.0,Silvaner,Rainer Sauer,"A fresh green-floral touch persists throughout this refreshing dry Silvaner. Light-footed in style, it offers crisp green-plum flavor accented by zippy flashes of lime and lemon zest. The finish is invigorating and brisk."
US,90,45.0,Pinot Noir,Raptor Ridge,"Here is the most engaging offering of the winery's 2013 single vineyard Pinots. It's bright with red-berry fruit and tropical-candy highlights. Meyer lemon peeks in, and the tangy fruit flavors continue into a finish of medium weight and length. Drink now and over the next couple of years."
France,90,15.0,Sylvaner,René Muré,"Grated lime zest on the nose leads to an uncompromisingly but refreshingly brisk palate. This has freshness and a stony, almost chalky depth and wonderful concentration and freshness. It's dry, brisk and invigorating."
US,90,48.0,Pinot Noir,Soléna,"A bit stiff, this expresses its terroir with accents of earth and clay around muted red fruits. Streaks of sassafras, coconut and vanilla emerge as the wine breathes open. Decant this one for at least an hour or two."
US,90,35.0,Petite Sirah,Spangler,"This is a real tongue-stainer, earthy and packed with purple fruits. Flavors of blueberries, plums, bitter chocolate and charred wood abound. The wine remains lively with ample acidity and smooth, though dense tannins."
US,90,24.0,Zinfandel,Napa Cellars,"This well-made wine blends in a hearty 17% Petite Sirah, providing additional power and dusty berry flavor. Sultry and velvety on the palate, it's spicy and peppery in subtle measure, with a juicy cheeriness on the lengthy finish."
US,90,95.0,Red Blend,Paraduxx,"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea."
US,90,32.0,Zinfandel,Peter Franus,"Peppery leather opens up this wine, blended with 5% Mourvèdre. More savory than fruity, it pleases in big tannin weight and length, with an intensity of brambly wildness and a sagey, smoky edge."
Spain,90,26.0,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Vargas,"Typical for this winery, this smells a bit herbal, with tomato and earthy plum aromas leading the way. Scratchy, grabby tannins support savory, herbal berry flavors. Hard tannins struggle to resolve themselves on a firm, muscular finish."
Spain,90,32.0,Tempranillo Blend,Remelluri,"This is a ripe, earthy, modern-leaning Rioja with aromas of blackberry, raisin and rubber. Soft and fleshy on the palate, what this easygoing number lacks in structure is made up for in charm. Ultraripe flavors of plum and berry come with a chocolaty accent, while the finish is smooth and tastes earthy and spicy. Drink through 2019."
US,90,24.0,Zinfandel,Steele,"Brilliant, pure fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but easy-to-drink wine. Cherry, strawberry and something deeper like black currant dance through the aromas and coat the tongue with their richness. The texture is smooth and plush due to fine tannins and mild acidity."
Germany,90,25.0,Schwartzriesling,Weinreich,"Dark shades of bramble and smoked nuts lend a shadowy mystique to this unusual Schwartzriesling, otherwise known as Pinot Meunier. Full bodied yet elegant, the palate boasts tart blackberry and raspberry flavors framed in finely grained tannins. A rare chance to experience this grape as a single varietal wine."
Spain,90,50.0,Garnacha,Contino,"Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019."
,90,30.0,Red Blend,Büyülübağ,"A blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this inky garnet-colored wine offers aromas of cassis and elderberry. On the palate, there is a combination of cooked fruit and cool spice flavors yet there is no lack of accompanying acidity. Flavors of cassis, elderberry, anise, orange peel and vanilla are backed by silky tannins that stay smooth into the cooling finish."
Italy,90,60.0,Sangiovese,Carpineto,"Scorched earth, cured meat, toasted nut and grilled herb aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The warm, ripe palate doles out raspberry jam, mature black cherry, vanilla and star anise framed in firm, velvety tannins."
US,90,12.0,Merlot,Charles Smith,"The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price."
France,90,50.0,Chardonnay,Château de Santenay,"The picturesque name of the wine, the vineyard where God sits, comes from a monopole—a walled property in the hills behind Beaune, wholly owned by the Château de Santenay. Ripe and smooth with an attractive, crisp texture, the wine is ready to drink. A touch of toast gives extra interest."
Italy,90,85.0,Sangiovese,Cordella,"Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019–2023."
US,90,42.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Davis Family,"A majority of Grenache plays lead here, with an accompaniment of 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvedre. Concentrated in a grip of leather, there's further integration of earth and black fruit that stays bright and vibrant on the palate, a medium-bodied coming-together of savory with ripe."
France,90,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Chavet,"Produced from 25-year-old vines, this is a fresh as well as ripe wine, well balanced between herbal flavors and white and citrus fruitiness. It has a rounded texture that is juicy as well as full in the mouth. The wine is ready to drink."
US,90,72.0,Champagne Blend,Sparkling Pointe,"Complexities of mushroom, caramel and brioche lend a haze of maturity over delicate strawberry and cherry notes in this Champagne-style sparkling,which was aged for eight years over lees. Tiny, persistent bubbles spread seamlessly on the palate, accentuated by streaks of racy acidity."
US,90,66.0,Sangiovese-Syrah,Stolpman,"Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure."
US,90,18.0,Vermentino,Bailiwick,"Buy this for its balance and welcome sense of restraint that gives way to richness on the finish. Crisp apple and light citrus aromas, then nicely concentrated and similar flavors, put an attractive spin on this medium-bodied, fresh and appealing wine."
France,90,32.0,White Blend,Domaine des Baumard,"What Baumard describes as a “secret blend” from its vineyards, this wine is both sweet and fresh. Honey and intense acidity are filled out with baked apple and lemon-marmalade flavors. It is ready to drink in all its fresh glory."
France,90,19.0,Rosé,E. Guigal,"Guigal does a terrific job with its regional wines, and this rosé is no exception. Notes of crushed stone and underripe pineapple broaden out into red berries and white chocolate on the weighty but balanced palate."
US,90,44.0,Pinot Noir,Freeman,"Layered aromas and rich but vibrant flavors help this medium-bodied wine stand out. It has a medium color with a brickish rim, while aromas suggest black tea and black cherry. A dry, tangy, but ripe fruit expression on the tongue lingers on the finish."
Spain,90,90.0,Red Blend,Huerta de Albalá,"Aromas of earthy, nutty, mature berry fruits come with a hint of raisin and a touch of compost. This saturated Vino de Cádiz is composed of 80% Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a heavy wine with flavors of vanilla, burnt wood, blackened spices and stewed berries. The finish tastes peppery, dark and outright woody. Drink through 2019."
Spain,90,33.0,Red Blend,Huerta de Albalá,"This blend from Cádiz features Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's big, ripe and minty on the nose, with hints of animal fur and leather. A blocky, full palate weighs in at 15.5%, while flavors of oak and vanilla blend well with spiced berry fruit. A drying finish tastes mostly of oak. Drink through 2025."
US,90,45.0,Chardonnay,Kunde,"From older vines on the producer's estate, this wine has a depth of richness to the nose and is intensely powerful in gingerbread and Meyer lemon on the medium-bodied palate. Lemony acidity rounds out the finish, flecked in butter."
US,90,30.0,Pinot Noir,La Voix,"There is much buzz about this new Steve and Chrystal Clifton (of Palmina and Brewer-Clifton) project that finds inspiration for wine from music. This orange-mauve-pink rosé is redolent with the familiar Pinot components of cherry, sagebrush and clove. On the palate, iron, graphite and wild herbs spice up the pomegranate fruit. It's very varietally pure."

US,90,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray,"This 100% varietal wine offers plenty of crisp cranberry, currant and restrained red fruit on the palate, the texture soft and supple. A pleasing shock of dark chocolate appears on the finish."
US,90,125.0,Cabernet Franc,Oakville East,"Leather and peppercorn jump from the glass in this soft, strong wine, powerful in tannin and dusty earth. A gravelly, rocky component plays on the palate around waves of chocolate and black currant, finishing in herb."
US,90,38.0,Red Blend,Quivira,"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa."
Italy,90,28.0,Red Blend,Castello della Paneretta,"Red berry, chopped herb, blue flower and menthol all come together on this elegantly structured red. The juicy, accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2021."
Spain,90,32.0,Red Blend,Edetària,"Smoky, oaky, rubbery aromas are sophisticated and inviting. This blend of 90% Garnacha and 10% Carignan feels smooth, but with a healthy pulse. Plum and cherry flavors carry a note of oaky char, while a long, toasty finish offers a complex note of cured meat. Drink through 2020."
US,90,55.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frog's Leap,"From the heart of the Rutherford Bench, this estate-grown wine is a classic version of restraint and elegance, structured in dusty tannin with bursts of cedar, tomato leaf and cassis. Cabernet Franc makes up 8% of the blend, with 3% Merlot. This will benefit from time in the cellar; drink 2020–2023."
US,90,85.0,Pinot Noir,Hirsch,"Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018."
US,90,35.0,Chardonnay,Keenan,"Decadent and candied, this is an oaky, well-made wine with richness at its core. Tahitian vanilla, caramel and Meyer lemon give way to more weighty tropical characteristics, making for a ripe, bigger-styled wine."
France,90,17.0,Rosé,Lavau,"This mid-sized négociant has turned out a solid Tavel. It's classic red-berry hue is typical for the appellation, followed by ample weight on the palate and bold cherry-berry flavors—all wrapped up by a long, mouthwatering finish."
US,90,48.0,Red Blend,Marianello,"This ambitious blend of 60% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot, 15% Petite Sirah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon largely succeeds, with aromas of tight blueberries, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of crushed peppercorn. The fruit-driven palate is dense with blueberry, tart boysenberry and a dusting of cocoa."
US,90,16.0,Syrah,Michael David,"This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends. New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression. Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture."
Hungary,90,26.0,Furmint,Oremus,"This late harvest wine reminds one of lemon grass, cut grass and honeysuckle. It is sweet with a good acid balance along with flavors of lemon meringue pie and lemon curd."
US,90,28.0,Sparkling Blend,Argyle,"Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity."
US,90,50.0,Pinot Noir,Argyle,"Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration."
US,90,32.0,Pinot Gris,Big Table Farm,"A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach."
Germany,90,23.0,Riesling,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,"A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Cantina del Nebbiolo,"Mature black fruit, toast and spice aromas lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound, offering baked black cherry, licorice and espresso balanced by youthfully assertive, taut tannins. Drink after 2019."
Italy,90,44.0,Nebbiolo,Cantina del Pino,"Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016."
Israel,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carmel,"A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate."
Argentina,90,30.0,Malbec,Ricominciare,"This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now."
US,90,28.0,Pinot Gris,Antiquum Farm,"This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish."
Italy,90,46.0,Nebbiolo,Beni di Batasiolo,"Red rose, wild berry, toast, tobacco and a whiff of underbrush meld in the glass. On the firm palate, notes of clove, ground pepper, cinnamon, anise and mocha accent the red berry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins offer structure."
Argentina,90,24.0,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata,"Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off."
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Brandini,"Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022."
US,90,33.0,Zinfandel,Carol Shelton,"A field blend of 85% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah, this juicy, spicy wine is robust and full bodied. Blackberry syrup and black cherry combine around cinnamon and black pepper, finishing in a wave of power."
Italy,90,25.0,Barbera,Cascina delle Rose,"Fresh and refined, this delightful, easy-drinking wine opens with scents of rose, woodland berry and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant, savory palate offers juicy red cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018."
France,90,13.0,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Bélingard,"Monbazillac, with its impressive castle, is part of the Bergerac region that makes some beautiful dessert wines. This wine, with its refreshing balance between acidity and rich honeyed flavors, conveys Seville orange marmalade and lemon acidity, with a smooth, botrytis aftertaste. Drink now, or better age until 2017."
France,90,16.0,Melon,Château de la Ragotiere,"Named after the winemaker, Amélie Couillard, this soft, rounded wine is smooth with creamed apple flavors while also having a proper tangy of acidity. That tight and tangy edge makes the wine refreshing now while also allowing it to age for a few more months. Drink now or from late 2016."
France,90,50.0,Malbec-Merlot,Château Eugénie,"This wine is very structured and firm. With some barrel aging, the tannins have been smoothed out although the wine remains with a dry core and fresh acidity. Black-currant flavors dominate, giving a wine that is bright and fruity at the end."
France,90,19.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Laulerie,"An impressive blend of Merlot and Malbec, this is a solid, dark wine packed with both tannins and ripe berry fruits. It has a serious character with toast, acidity and complex spice flavors. Drink from 2018."
France,90,13.0,Tannat-Cabernet Franc,Château Peyros,"This ripe wine with open fruits has 40% Cabernet Franc in the blend, which lends an attractive perfumed character and gives the wine rich character and fruitiness. It will age for a few more years and be ready to drink from 2017."
US,90,50.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Clos La Chance,"Roast beef, grape candy, cracked blueberry, beef char and grapy freshness come to the nose on this bottling. The candied grape and blueberry elements carry dark-fruit character to the palate, along with licorice that gives depth. Roasting herbs in the midpalate adds savory flair."
US,90,50.0,Pinot Noir,David Hill,"At David Hill, the Winemakers Cuvée is a cut above the reserve. It's a muscular blend of scents and flavors of lavender, cherry and chocolate wrapped into a firm, focused finish."
Italy,90,35.0,Nebbiolo,Deltetto,"Wild berry, grilled herb, aniseed and a hint of vanilla are some of the aromas you'll find on this attractive red. The linear, elegantly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and grilled sage while a tobacco note closes the firm finish."
US,90,30.0,Chardonnay,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy."
Germany,90,25.0,Pinot Blanc,Franz Keller,Pristine white peaches seem suspended in a crystalline solution of river rocks and mineral water in this refreshing dry Pinot Blanc. It's delicate in stature but abounds in elegance. Drink now through 2020.
Italy,90,,Nebbiolo,Gianpiero Marrone,"Raspberry, rose petal, baking spice, tilled soil and new leather aromas unfold on this structured red. The chewy, full-bodied palate doles out juicy wild cherry, menthol and dark cooking spice while assertive tannins and fresh acidity lend balance. Drink 2019–2029."
US,90,40.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen,"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch. Tobacco forms around a juiciness of blackberry and raspberry, giving it a sultry edge, while maintaing soft tannins throughout."
Spain,90,55.0,Mencía,Luna Beberide,"Smooth, deep aromas of licorice and blackberry are composed. This Mencía feels full and lusty, with grip but nothing too hard or edgy. Earthy black fruit flavors are savory, toasty and meaty, while the finish is woody and plump. Drink through 2020."
Portugal,90,100.0,Portuguese Red,Magnum Vinhos,"Despite its richness, this is a stylish wine that exudes freshness as much as dense fruit and structure. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, all structured varieties, it still yields a generous full-bodied and rounded wine. It does need to age, so drink from 2018."
US,90,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mathew Bruno,"Sourced from the southeastern section of the Rutherford appellation and 100% varietal, this is a seamlessly made wine, luxurious in cherry pie and leather saddle. Tangy acidity meets the dusty tannins head-on, finishing with a burst of orange zest."
US,90,28.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Merryvale,"While barrel-influenced and full-bodied, this unctuous wine remains crisp in edgy acidity, with lean flavors of lemon and grapefruit amidst a deeper, richer background of oak and caramel."
US,93,32.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander,"Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine. Its acidity is almost effervescent, infusing the palate with boundless energy, while its chalky grip carries sharp green apple notes alongside warmer touches of pineapple and guava. Those vivid flavors linger for a full minute."
